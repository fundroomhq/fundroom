Add the storage, email, KMS and HTTP kernel adapters. `@fundroom/ports` gains `ObjectStoragePort` (with `assertObjectKey`, `StorageError`), `KmsPort` (`KmsError`), `MailDeliveryEvent` and a richer `MailerPort` (`driver`, `send → SentEmail`, optional `parseWebhook`, `healthCheck`), and `OutboundHttpError`. `@fundroom/storage` holds the object key layout (`ws/<id>/blobs/<sha256>`, quarantine and rendition prefixes), upload policy constants and the port contract test suite; `@fundroom/storage-s3` (AWS SDK v3, presigned multipart, S3-compatible checksum settings) and `@fundroom/storage-fs` (atomic local files plus a tus resumable-upload server) implement it. `@fundroom/kms-local` wraps per-workspace data keys under the config key ring; `@fundroom/crypto` adds the chunked AES-256-GCM object format, the `core.workspace_key` envelope service (migration `0003_workspace_key` in `@fundroom/db`) and the `crypto.rewrap` job. `@fundroom/email-smtp` implements `MailerPort` over nodemailer; `@fundroom/mail` renders React Email templates for the identity emails and ships memory/log mailers; `@fundroom/identity` emails now name their template. `@fundroom/outbound-http` is the SSRF-guarded fetch (DNS pre-resolution, private-range deny, pinned address, redirect re-checks, timeout and size caps). `@fundroom/http` adds the security-headers middleware (per-request CSP nonce, `frame-ancestors` per profile, HSTS, COOP/CORP, Referrer-Policy, `X-Robots-Tag`). `@fundroom/config` gains `KMS_DRIVER`, `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`, `MAIL_FROM_NAME`, `OUTBOUND_HTTP_ALLOW_PRIVATE[_HOSTS]`, `HSTS`, `HSTS_PRELOAD`.
