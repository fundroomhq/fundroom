# @fundroom/embed

## 0.2.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add `@fundroom/embed`, the browser loader for the iframe embed. `SeedHost.init({workspace, baseUrl, el, path, theme, locale, consent, history, minHeight, maxHeight, title, handoff, onEvent})` mounts one cross-origin iframe on the portal origin with the pinned `sandbox` / `allow` / `title` attributes, and returns a portal with `on`/`off`, `navigate`, `setTheme`, `setConsent`, `logout` and `destroy`. It speaks the frozen v1 bridge (`{v:1,type,payload}`) against `apps/web/src/embed/bridge.ts`: one explicit target origin in each direction — never `"*"` — inbound messages pinned to both the portal origin and our own frame, and an unknown message type ignored rather than thrown, so an old loader keeps working with a newer core. Height comes from the child's `resize`, debounced and clamped between `minHeight` and `maxHeight` (over the max the frame scrolls internally), with a skeleton min-height so the host page does not shift. History sync writes `?sh=/updates` (or the fragment, or nothing) with `replaceState`, `pushState` on an explicit `navigate`, carrying the host router's own `history.state` through untouched, restoring the path on load and following the host's back button. Consent folds GPC as a negative-only signal (`granted = analytics && !gpc`), read in the host page, so a host CMP can never turn measurement on over it. Every failure mode ends in a link to `/w/<slug>` plus a console message naming the exact CSP directives: an insecure host page (refused outright — a `Secure; Partitioned` cookie cannot be set), a 5 s `ready` timeout, an iframe error; a `MutationObserver` remounts and restores the path when a host router destroys the container. The parent also posts `viewport {top, height}` — the frame is sized to its content so it never scrolls, the host page does, and only the parent can see which part of the frame the reader is looking at; the child needs it to place a dialog in the visible region instead of 2 400px above it. It is sent on `ready`, on host `scroll` and `resize` (passive, capture, `requestAnimationFrame`-throttled, suppressed when the numbers have not moved) and when the frame's own height changes, once with `height: 0` while off-screen; it is a hint the child must work without, because a hand-pasted `<iframe>` snippet has no loader to send it. Two builds via esbuild — IIFE (`window.SeedHost`, 3.8 KB gzip against a 5 KB budget the build enforces) and ESM — are compiled into `src/generated/artifacts.ts` and exposed at `@fundroom/embed/artifacts` with their `sha384` integrity values and an SRI manifest, so `apps/server` can serve the loader from memory; `codegen:check` is the drift gate. The package versions independently of the core (`.changeset/README.md`) and starts at `0.1.0` to match `MIN_EMBED_SDK`.

### Patch Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - The product is now called **FundRoom**, step 1 of the rename: what people
  see. `INSTANCE_NAME` and `PASSKEY_RP_NAME` default to `FundRoom`; emails, the setup banner, the
  "Powered by" line, SDK and embed error messages, export and audit-bundle READMEs and docs say
  FundRoom; the mail default accent is the app primary `#1d4ed8` (was `#1f4b99`); a new interim mark
  ships as `favicon.svg`, PNG icons and `site.webmanifest`; outbound `User-Agent` is
  `FundRoom/<version>`. The image is `ghcr.io/fundroomhq/fundroom` and the Helm chart is
  `deploy/helm/fundroom` (`oci://ghcr.io/fundroomhq/charts/fundroom`; its selector labels change, so
  reinstall a release made from a local checkout of the old chart). PaaS templates name their
  services `fundroom*`, dev hosts are `*.fundroom.localhost`, the security contact is
  `security@fundroom.com` and the update index defaults to `https://releases.fundroom.com/index.json`.
  The WordPress plugin is displayed as FundRoom; its slug and text domain stay `seed-host`.
  Identifiers (`@seed-host/*`, the `seedhost` CLI, `SEEDHOST_*`, `_seedhost-challenge`, headers,
  meters, metrics) are renamed with aliases in the next step. Cryptographic labels and export format
  ids never change.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - The identifiers now carry the FundRoom name too, step 2 of the rename. An
  existing install upgrades without changes and keeps working; `docs/runbooks/install-and-upgrade.md`
  ("Renamed identifiers") lists what to rename and when.
  
  Renamed, with the old name still read:
  
  - `SEEDHOST_SECRET_KEY` (+ `_FILE`) is `FUNDROOM_SECRET_KEY` (+ `_FILE`). The old name is read when
    the new one is unset, and `doctor` and boot warn; it will be removed in a later release. **Upgrade
    the image first, rename after:** an older image reads only the old name and, finding only
    `FUNDROOM_SECRET_KEY`, generates a new key. So both names set to the **same** value (file contents
    for `_FILE`, trailing newlines stripped) are accepted, with a warning that the old name can go once
    no older image runs. Different values are a configuration error. It names every variable set with
    the key fingerprint `doctor` prints (`sha256:<12 hex>` of the key bytes), says that on an upgraded
    install the OLD name normally holds the data's key, and asks you to match the fingerprints before
    deleting anything. For one minor release the Helm chart's Secrets and the Coolify stacks set both
    names from one value. The Render Blueprint keeps generating `SEEDHOST_SECRET_KEY`, because Render
    generates one random value per name. Helm accepts an `existingSecret` that still holds the old key.
  - Compose also reads `SEEDHOST_DOMAIN` / `SEEDHOST_IMAGE` when `FUNDROOM_DOMAIN` / `FUNDROOM_IMAGE`
    are unset. The shipped Caddyfile honours `SEEDHOST_DOMAIN` / `SEEDHOST_BASE_PATH` as well (its
    `/internal/*` and `/metrics` refusals cover both prefixes) and refuses to start with both base-path
    names set.
  - The CLI is `fundroom` (package CLIs `fundroom-audit`, `fundroom-db`). `seedhost`, `seedhost-audit`
    and `seedhost-db` still work for one more minor release and print a note on stderr.
  
  Accepted indefinitely (values other systems hold):
  
  - Custom-domain TXT `_seedhost-challenge` beside the new `_fundroom-challenge`, and SSO TXT
    `_seedhost-sso` / `seedhost-sso=` beside `_fundroom-sso` / `fundroom-sso=`. The new label is looked
    up first; the verdict names the label that matched; instructions show only the new one.
  - API keys `shk_…` and SCIM tokens `shs_…`. New ones are minted as `frk_…` / `frs_…`; migration
    `0027_fundroom_identifiers` widens the API-key prefix check, and the `.gitleaks.toml` rules
    (`fundroom-api-key`, new `fundroom-scim-token`) match both.
  - DocuSeal's `X-Seedhost-Signature` beside `X-Fundroom-Signature`. Every one of the two that is
    present must match the secret.
  
  Sent under both names until the next minor release, then the old one is removed:
  `X-Seedhost-Cell` (with `X-Fundroom-Cell` on `421 wrong_cell`), `X-Seedhost-Export-Truncated` (with
  `X-Fundroom-Export-Truncated` on the Q&A CSV export; deprecated in OpenAPI), and
  `/.well-known/seed-host.json` (with `/.well-known/fundroom.json`).
  
  Changed with no alias:
  
  - Prometheus/OTel metrics `seed_host_*` / `seedhost_*` are `fundroom_*`
    (`fundroom_security_events_total`, `fundroom_csp_violations_total`, `fundroom_authz_*`), and the
    meter scopes `seed-host.{http,authz,security,csp}` are `fundroom.{http,authz,security,csp}`.
  - The `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` default, the log `service` fallback and pg-boss's `application_name` are
    `fundroom`.
  - User-Agents `FundRoom-Webhooks/1` (was `SeedHost-Webhooks/1`) and `fundroom-authz-engine/1` (was
    `seed-host-authz-engine/1`).
  - Stripe meter event names are settings, `BILLING_METER_SEATS_EVENT` and
    `BILLING_METER_STORAGE_EVENT`, defaulting to `fundroom_staff_seats` / `fundroom_storage_gb` (were
    the fixed `seedhost_*` names).
    The usage report logs `billing.usage_meter_unknown` (warn) when a subscription bills on a meter
    whose event name is neither setting.
  - The npm scope is `@fundroom/*`, and the SDK exports `FundRoomClient`, `createFundRoomClient`,
    `FundRoomApiError`, `FundRoomSchemas` and the other former `SeedHost*` names.
  - The PDF `Producer` of generated clickwrap and e-sign documents is `FundRoom clickwrap` /
    `FundRoom esign`. Not evidence: the PDF digest is not what the audit trail relies on.
  - The Stripe Checkout idempotency-key prefix is `fundroom:checkout:` (was `seedhost:checkout:`).
    The keys are per-attempt random UUIDs, so at most a Checkout retried across the upgrade gets a
    fresh key.
  - The design-token source file is `packages/ui/tokens/fundroom.tokens.json` (was
    `seed-host.tokens.json`). The package export `@fundroomhq/ui/tokens.json` is unchanged.
  
  Operator actions: after the new image runs everywhere, set `FUNDROOM_SECRET_KEY` to the same value
  as `SEEDHOST_SECRET_KEY`, and remove the old name only when no older image can run again (on
  Render, leave the Blueprint's `SEEDHOST_SECRET_KEY` alone); rename `SEEDHOST_DOMAIN` / `SEEDHOST_IMAGE` in a Compose `.env`;
  switch scripts to the `fundroom` CLI; move edge routing to `X-Fundroom-Cell` and probes to
  `/.well-known/fundroom.json` before the next minor release; update dashboards and alerts for the
  metric and scope names, and filters on the old User-Agents; on a managed host billing by meter, set
  `BILLING_METER_*_EVENT` to your existing Stripe meter names or create meters with the new ones.
  Nothing to do for TXT records, API keys, SCIM tokens or the DocuSeal header; rename those when
  convenient.
  
  Rolling back: an older image rejects `frk_` / `frs_` tokens minted after the upgrade (re-mint them),
  has only the `seedhost*` bins, and sends only the old headers and metric names.
  
  Never renamed: cryptographic labels, export format ids, database names and roles, Compose project
  names, the pgBackRest stanza, the WordPress plugin's slug, and the embed API (`SeedHost.init`).

- [#23](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/pull/23) [`4265061`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/42650614e5168992cf206e31cd06723a4b4212b9) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - The version PR passes its own CI. `pnpm version-packages` now runs `scripts/release/version-artifacts.mjs` after `changeset version`, which regenerates the files that carry a version: the embed loader's `src/generated/artifacts.ts` (banner, pinned URL segment, SRI digests) and the OpenAPI document's `info.version`. The loader's `VERSION` is generated from `package.json` (`src/generated/version.ts`) instead of being a hand-kept constant. The pinned loader URL also accepts a pre-release version (`/embed/1.0.0-rc.0/embed.js`), which the router refused with a 404, and the web app's list of server paths matches it.
