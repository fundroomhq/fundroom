### Minor Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add e-signature, the round closing workflow and signed-document vaulting.
  
  **E-signature.** A workspace connects one vendor under `/admin/esign`: Documenso or DocuSeal (cloud or self-hosted), DocuSign or Dropbox Sign, reached over their APIs only. Credentials are sealed per workspace, verified with the vendor before they are stored, and never shown again. Vendor callbacks arrive at `/webhooks/esign/{connectionId}`. They are authenticated per vendor and treated only as a wake-up: the server then asks the vendor for the envelope's status. A five-minute sweep backs them up. Signed PDFs (and the vendor's certificate where separate) are size-capped, scanned and stored encrypted.
  
  **E-sign NDA.** A legal document's ceremony can be click-wrap (default) or e-signature (NDA documents only). Investors record ESIGN consent to electronic records, sign in the vendor's UI (opened top-level, never inside an embed frame), and the completed envelope writes the same acceptance a click-wrap does, so the portal gate and NDA gates on folders and documents open as before.
  
  **Closing workflow.** A round's Closing tab sends subscription documents from a vendor template, prefilled from the round's terms, and tracks each commitment through documents sent, signed, wired and confirmed, with a summary of counts and amounts. Investors see their own checklist and download their signed copy.
  
  **Vaulting.** Completed envelopes are filed into the data room under legal hold, in staff-only folders that no investor, delegate or share-link grant can open.
  
  **Fixes found along the way.**
  - An NDA or accreditation gate on a sub-folder or document now applies to members granted an ancestor folder (it previously did not).
  - The workspace row is now always locked before the audit chain, removing a class of deadlocks between settings, acceptance, group and document writers.
  - The first concurrent use of a new encryption-key purpose no longer fails with an aborted transaction.
  
  **Configuration.** New: `ESIGN_DRIVERS`, `ESIGN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`, `ESIGN_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES`. Migrations: core `0019_esign`, round `0004_closing`, data-room `0004_vault` and `0005_staff_only`, notify `0010_esign_event_types`. Operator guide in `docs/esign/`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - The identifiers now carry the FundRoom name too, step 2 of the rename. An
  existing install upgrades without changes and keeps working; `docs/runbooks/install-and-upgrade.md`
  ("Renamed identifiers") lists what to rename and when.
  
  Renamed, with the old name still read:
  
  - `SEEDHOST_SECRET_KEY` (+ `_FILE`) is `FUNDROOM_SECRET_KEY` (+ `_FILE`). The old name is read when
    the new one is unset, and `doctor` and boot warn; it will be removed in a later release. **Upgrade
    the image first, rename after:** an older image reads only the old name and, finding only
    `FUNDROOM_SECRET_KEY`, generates a new key. So both names set to the **same** value (file contents
    for `_FILE`, trailing newlines stripped) are accepted, with a warning that the old name can go once
    no older image runs. Different values are a configuration error. It names every variable set with
    the key fingerprint `doctor` prints (`sha256:<12 hex>` of the key bytes), says that on an upgraded
    install the OLD name normally holds the data's key, and asks you to match the fingerprints before
    deleting anything. For one minor release the Helm chart's Secrets and the Coolify stacks set both
    names from one value. The Render Blueprint keeps generating `SEEDHOST_SECRET_KEY`, because Render
    generates one random value per name. Helm accepts an `existingSecret` that still holds the old key.
  - Compose also reads `SEEDHOST_DOMAIN` / `SEEDHOST_IMAGE` when `FUNDROOM_DOMAIN` / `FUNDROOM_IMAGE`
    are unset. The shipped Caddyfile honours `SEEDHOST_DOMAIN` / `SEEDHOST_BASE_PATH` as well (its
    `/internal/*` and `/metrics` refusals cover both prefixes) and refuses to start with both base-path
    names set.
  - The CLI is `fundroom` (package CLIs `fundroom-audit`, `fundroom-db`). `seedhost`, `seedhost-audit`
    and `seedhost-db` still work for one more minor release and print a note on stderr.
  
  Accepted indefinitely (values other systems hold):
  
  - Custom-domain TXT `_seedhost-challenge` beside the new `_fundroom-challenge`, and SSO TXT
    `_seedhost-sso` / `seedhost-sso=` beside `_fundroom-sso` / `fundroom-sso=`. The new label is looked
    up first; the verdict names the label that matched; instructions show only the new one.
  - API keys `shk_…` and SCIM tokens `shs_…`. New ones are minted as `frk_…` / `frs_…`; migration
    `0027_fundroom_identifiers` widens the API-key prefix check, and the `.gitleaks.toml` rules
    (`fundroom-api-key`, new `fundroom-scim-token`) match both.
  - DocuSeal's `X-Seedhost-Signature` beside `X-Fundroom-Signature`. Every one of the two that is
    present must match the secret.
  
  Sent under both names until the next minor release, then the old one is removed:
  `X-Seedhost-Cell` (with `X-Fundroom-Cell` on `421 wrong_cell`), `X-Seedhost-Export-Truncated` (with
  `X-Fundroom-Export-Truncated` on the Q&A CSV export; deprecated in OpenAPI), and
  `/.well-known/seed-host.json` (with `/.well-known/fundroom.json`).
  
  Changed with no alias:
  
  - Prometheus/OTel metrics `seed_host_*` / `seedhost_*` are `fundroom_*`
    (`fundroom_security_events_total`, `fundroom_csp_violations_total`, `fundroom_authz_*`), and the
    meter scopes `seed-host.{http,authz,security,csp}` are `fundroom.{http,authz,security,csp}`.
  - The `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` default, the log `service` fallback and pg-boss's `application_name` are
    `fundroom`.
  - User-Agents `FundRoom-Webhooks/1` (was `SeedHost-Webhooks/1`) and `fundroom-authz-engine/1` (was
    `seed-host-authz-engine/1`).
  - Stripe meter event names are settings, `BILLING_METER_SEATS_EVENT` and
    `BILLING_METER_STORAGE_EVENT`, defaulting to `fundroom_staff_seats` / `fundroom_storage_gb` (were
    the fixed `seedhost_*` names).
    The usage report logs `billing.usage_meter_unknown` (warn) when a subscription bills on a meter
    whose event name is neither setting.
  - The npm scope is `@fundroom/*`, and the SDK exports `FundRoomClient`, `createFundRoomClient`,
    `FundRoomApiError`, `FundRoomSchemas` and the other former `SeedHost*` names.
  - The PDF `Producer` of generated clickwrap and e-sign documents is `FundRoom clickwrap` /
    `FundRoom esign`. Not evidence: the PDF digest is not what the audit trail relies on.
  - The Stripe Checkout idempotency-key prefix is `fundroom:checkout:` (was `seedhost:checkout:`).
    The keys are per-attempt random UUIDs, so at most a Checkout retried across the upgrade gets a
    fresh key.
  - The design-token source file is `packages/ui/tokens/fundroom.tokens.json` (was
    `seed-host.tokens.json`). The package export `@fundroomhq/ui/tokens.json` is unchanged.
  
  Operator actions: after the new image runs everywhere, set `FUNDROOM_SECRET_KEY` to the same value
  as `SEEDHOST_SECRET_KEY`, and remove the old name only when no older image can run again (on
  Render, leave the Blueprint's `SEEDHOST_SECRET_KEY` alone); rename `SEEDHOST_DOMAIN` / `SEEDHOST_IMAGE` in a Compose `.env`;
  switch scripts to the `fundroom` CLI; move edge routing to `X-Fundroom-Cell` and probes to
  `/.well-known/fundroom.json` before the next minor release; update dashboards and alerts for the
  metric and scope names, and filters on the old User-Agents; on a managed host billing by meter, set
  `BILLING_METER_*_EVENT` to your existing Stripe meter names or create meters with the new ones.
  Nothing to do for TXT records, API keys, SCIM tokens or the DocuSeal header; rename those when
  convenient.
  
  Rolling back: an older image rejects `frk_` / `frs_` tokens minted after the upgrade (re-mint them),
  has only the `seedhost*` bins, and sends only the old headers and metric names.
  
  Never renamed: cryptographic labels, export format ids, database names and roles, Compose project
  names, the pgBackRest stanza, the WordPress plugin's slug, and the embed API (`SeedHost.init`).

### Patch Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Per-tenant data residency. A cell is now a complete deployment in one region, with its own database, bucket, job queue, backups and key ring, and a workspace's region is the region of its cell. Without `DIRECTORY_DATABASE_URL` nothing changes for an existing install, except that `data_region` is filled in, the residency page exists and the DPA's data-location annex fills in.
  
  - **Declared region.** `DATA_REGION`, `DATA_REGION_LABEL`, `DATA_REGION_JURISDICTION` and `BACKUP_LOCATION` say where the cell is. Boot adopts them into the cell rows and refuses (prod and staging) a local cell in another region. Core migration `0024_data_residency` enforces one database = one region, derives `workspace.data_region` from the cell, and adds the `relocation` hold. `fundroom cell add` takes `--label` and `--jurisdiction`.
  - **Directory.** `@fundroom/directory` at `DIRECTORY_DATABASE_URL` (needs `CONTROL_PLANE=on`, a declared region, S3 storage and a verified TLS connection in production, or `DIRECTORY_DATABASE_ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED_TLS`) holds cells, slugs, verified hostnames and moves, and no personal data. Slugs and custom hostnames are unique across every cell. A request for a workspace on another cell answers `421 wrong_cell` with `X-Fundroom-Cell`, and a soft-deleted workspace is held but never routed. `fundroom directory status|sync|migrate`. A directory outage never stops a cell from booting or serving its own tenants; only new slug claims answer 503 `directory_unavailable`.
  - **Moves between regions.** `fundroom workspace move <slug> --to <cell-id>`, or the operator console's "Move to another cell", holds the workspace under `relocation`, exports it signed and encrypted, has the target pull and verify it against the source cell's published key, imports it with its holds, plan and subscription, switches the directory from the source under its row lock, and crypto-shreds the source after `MOVE_SOURCE_RETENTION_HOURS`. The workspace is unavailable during the move, and members sign in again afterwards: sessions, factors, API keys, webhooks and vendor connections are not carried. `fundroom move list|cancel`; audit actions `workspace.move_*`.
  - **Residency page.** `GET /api/v1/residency` and Settings → Data residency show the declared region, where each component is (database, jobs, search, analytics, files, backups, email, virus scanning, telemetry), and every sub-processor of the deployment and of the workspace, flagged when outside the region. Staff can read it during a move.
  - **Generated sub-processor list.** Mail, storage and Cloudflare for SaaS adapters declare sub-processor metadata, and every vendor adapter declares a jurisdiction. The `dpa`, `sub-processors` and `privacy-notice` templates (version 2) are filled from them, with a new `{{dataLocation}}` annex and `{{workspaceSubProcessors}}` in the privacy notice. Transfer mechanisms are stated only where the software knows them.
  - **Signup.** `GET /api/v1/signup/regions` feeds a region picker that links to another region's signup page.
  
  Also fixed: the setup wizard, demo seed and workspace import placed new workspaces on the `default` cell whatever `CELL_ID` said. Inbound and outbound trace spans no longer export full URLs: share-link and invite tokens, OAuth codes, presigned links and webhook paths are reduced to the origin. The Helm chart's worker scratch volume was a fixed 64 MiB, which evicted the worker on any larger export; it is now `dataScratchSizeLimit` (default 4 GiB).
  
  Compose and Helm (`residency.*` values) pass every new key through with empty defaults. Docs: runbook `residency.md`; the Cells section of `control-plane.md`; backups per region in `backup-and-restore.md`.
