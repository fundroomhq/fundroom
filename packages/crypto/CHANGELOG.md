### Minor Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Analytics and notifications, full.
  
  **Email delivery feedback.** Three ESP adapters — `@fundroom/email-resend`, `@fundroom/email-postmark` and `@fundroom/email-ses` (`MAILER_DRIVER=resend|postmark|ses`) — send over dedicated guarded HTTP clients and verify their webhooks: Svix signatures for Resend, Basic auth for Postmark, SNS message signatures for SES with the certificate URL, topic ARN and subscription URL pinned. `MailerPort` gains `stream`, `tracking`, `ref`, `capabilities`, `open`/`click` event kinds and `MailSuppressedError`. The kernel records every workspace message it sends in `core.mail_message`, accepts provider webhooks at `/webhooks/email/<driver>`, and publishes `mail.delivery_recorded` into the right workspace. Opens and clicks are published only in `engagement` mode for members whose `email_tracking` consent allows it, checked again when the webhook arrives. `classifyEngagement` flags Apple Mail Privacy Protection, link scanners and opens with no user agent as automated. A hard bounce, complaint or provider-side suppression suppresses the address for that workspace's broadcast and notification mail, never for sign-in mail. The list is stored as a keyed hash that survives key rotation and is managed at `/admin/mail`. Update sends report delivered, bounced and complained.
  
  **Engagement analytics.** Per-document page heatmaps, per-update opens and clicks (human and automated reported separately), a consented, engagement-mode hot list with a CSV export and `analytics.hot_lead` alerts, per-workspace retention including per-member rollups, and a transparency notice that names email opens, clicks and engagement scoring.
  
  **Consent and erasure.** `legal.privacyRegion` suggests a consent mode (EU opt-in, UK opt-out, US notice-only) when it is set, and never rewrites a mode an admin chose. Global Privacy Control is now stored as a refusal, so it also covers facts that arrive without a browser. `legal.legalHold` blocks erasure and retention. DSAR erasure requests (`/compliance/erasure-requests`) carry a statutory due date and complete once every module that holds personal data has erased its own rows. That includes modules that are currently disabled.
  
  **Notifications.** Daily and weekly digests in each member's own time zone, catch-up after a missed run, quiet hours that hold emails but never the in-app inbox, an inbox with paging, archiving and mark-all-read, and Slack channels through the new `@fundroom/chat-slack` adapter and `ModuleServices.chat` (`notify.manage`). Instant mail is sent by a job outside the transaction that created it, with deterministic idempotency keys, retry backoff and a terminal failed state.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add the storage, email, KMS and HTTP kernel adapters. `@fundroom/ports` gains `ObjectStoragePort` (with `assertObjectKey`, `StorageError`), `KmsPort` (`KmsError`), `MailDeliveryEvent` and a richer `MailerPort` (`driver`, `send → SentEmail`, optional `parseWebhook`, `healthCheck`), and `OutboundHttpError`. `@fundroom/storage` holds the object key layout (`ws/<id>/blobs/<sha256>`, quarantine and rendition prefixes), upload policy constants and the port contract test suite; `@fundroom/storage-s3` (AWS SDK v3, presigned multipart, S3-compatible checksum settings) and `@fundroom/storage-fs` (atomic local files plus a tus resumable-upload server) implement it. `@fundroom/kms-local` wraps per-workspace data keys under the config key ring; `@fundroom/crypto` adds the chunked AES-256-GCM object format, the `core.workspace_key` envelope service (migration `0003_workspace_key` in `@fundroom/db`) and the `crypto.rewrap` job. `@fundroom/email-smtp` implements `MailerPort` over nodemailer; `@fundroom/mail` renders React Email templates for the identity emails and ships memory/log mailers; `@fundroom/identity` emails now name their template. `@fundroom/outbound-http` is the SSRF-guarded fetch (DNS pre-resolution, private-range deny, pinned address, redirect re-checks, timeout and size caps). `@fundroom/http` adds the security-headers middleware (per-request CSP nonce, `frame-ancestors` per profile, HSTS, COOP/CORP, Referrer-Policy, `X-Robots-Tag`). `@fundroom/config` gains `KMS_DRIVER`, `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`, `MAIL_FROM_NAME`, `OUTBOUND_HTTP_ALLOW_PRIVATE[_HOSTS]`, `HSTS`, `HSTS_PRELOAD`.

### Patch Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add e-signature, the round closing workflow and signed-document vaulting.
  
  **E-signature.** A workspace connects one vendor under `/admin/esign`: Documenso or DocuSeal (cloud or self-hosted), DocuSign or Dropbox Sign, reached over their APIs only. Credentials are sealed per workspace, verified with the vendor before they are stored, and never shown again. Vendor callbacks arrive at `/webhooks/esign/{connectionId}`. They are authenticated per vendor and treated only as a wake-up: the server then asks the vendor for the envelope's status. A five-minute sweep backs them up. Signed PDFs (and the vendor's certificate where separate) are size-capped, scanned and stored encrypted.
  
  **E-sign NDA.** A legal document's ceremony can be click-wrap (default) or e-signature (NDA documents only). Investors record ESIGN consent to electronic records, sign in the vendor's UI (opened top-level, never inside an embed frame), and the completed envelope writes the same acceptance a click-wrap does, so the portal gate and NDA gates on folders and documents open as before.
  
  **Closing workflow.** A round's Closing tab sends subscription documents from a vendor template, prefilled from the round's terms, and tracks each commitment through documents sent, signed, wired and confirmed, with a summary of counts and amounts. Investors see their own checklist and download their signed copy.
  
  **Vaulting.** Completed envelopes are filed into the data room under legal hold, in staff-only folders that no investor, delegate or share-link grant can open.
  
  **Fixes found along the way.**
  - An NDA or accreditation gate on a sub-folder or document now applies to members granted an ancestor folder (it previously did not).
  - The workspace row is now always locked before the audit chain, removing a class of deadlocks between settings, acceptance, group and document writers.
  - The first concurrent use of a new encryption-key purpose no longer fails with an aborted transaction.
  
  **Configuration.** New: `ESIGN_DRIVERS`, `ESIGN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`, `ESIGN_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES`. Migrations: core `0019_esign`, round `0004_closing`, data-room `0004_vault` and `0005_staff_only`, notify `0010_esign_event_types`. Operator guide in `docs/esign/`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Security hardening, following an ASVS 5.0 Level 2 review and an internal penetration test.
  
  **Upgrading: production and staging now refuse to boot on settings they used to accept.** Each error names its fix, and `docs/runbooks/install-and-upgrade.md` has an "Upgrading to the security-hardening release" section.
  1. `AV_DRIVER=noop` needs `AV_ACCEPT_UNSCANNED=true`, or run ClamAV (`AV_DRIVER=clamd`).
     - Helm: set `config.av.acceptUnscanned`.
     - PaaS services created from an older template: add the variable to web and worker.
  2. SMTP to a public relay needs `smtps://…:465` or `?requireTLS=true`.
     - Refused: `tls.rejectUnauthorized` set to anything but `true`, a truthy `ignoreTLS`, a repeated option, and backslashes or spaces in the URL.
  3. A public database host needs `sslmode=verify-full` or `verify-ca`.
     - The last `sslmode` in the URL wins, and a `host=` parameter counts as the host.
     - For a private CA, add `sslrootcert=`. Helm: `postgresql.external.caSecret`.
     - `DATABASE_ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED_TLS=true` is only for a host that really is private.
  4. `METRICS_ENABLED=true` needs `METRICS_TOKEN`. Without either, `/metrics` is off in prod. Caddy now refuses `/metrics` unless `EDGE_EXPOSE_METRICS=true`.
  5. Compose requires `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. An existing stack whose `.env` never set it was created with `seedhost`: set that, then rotate the password.
  6. `RATE_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER` (new, for k6 and ZAP runs) other than 1 is refused in prod, and whenever `APP_ENV` is not set explicitly.
  7. Client IP:
     - `TRUST_PROXY=true` now means one trusted hop counted from the right of `X-Forwarded-For`. `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` sets more hops, and `CLIENT_IP_HEADER` names a platform header. The Fly, Render and Railway templates set one.
     - `X-Forwarded-Host` and `-Proto` take their rightmost entry.
     - Caddy trusts forwarded headers only from `EDGE_TRUSTED_PROXIES`, default loopback. Behind a CDN or load balancer, set it and `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS=2`.
  8. HSTS:
     - `includeSubDomains` can be sent without `preload` (`HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`).
     - `includeSubDomains` and `preload` go only to the `BASE_URL` host and its subdomains, so customers' custom domains get plain `max-age`.
  
  **Authentication and sessions**
  - Managing a second factor needs the second factor.
    - Once a user has a TOTP or a passkey, disabling or enrolling TOTP, adding or removing a passkey, regenerating recovery codes, and setting or removing a password all need auth level 2 plus a recent sign-in.
    - A PIN-less passkey step-up in the same session also counts.
    - Every factor change signs out the user's other sessions and emails a security notice. Previously, someone holding a mailbox could replace an owner's second factor.
  - Session tokens:
    - The session token rotates on step-up and on login (the previous session is revoked, including share-link and embed logins).
    - Concurrent step-ups keep the winner's token.
  - Passwords:
    - Changing or removing an existing password needs `currentPassword`.
    - Signing out other sessions needs a recent sign-in.
  - OIDC:
    - Logins are level 1 unless the ID token's `amr`/`acr` shows MFA (`OIDC_MFA_ACR`) or `OIDC_TRUST_MFA=true`.
    - The flow is bound to the starting browser (`__Host-oidc_req`).
    - The ID-token signature is verified.
    - `returnTo` must be same-origin, inside `BASE_PATH`.
  - Sign-in answers the same for known and unknown addresses, including while mail is failing.
    - `/auth/otp/start` and `/auth/magic-link/start` no longer answer 503. Failures are logged as `auth.sign_in_mail_failed`.
    - Unknown addresses get a decoy challenge. Challenges are deleted 6 h after expiry.
  - TOTP and recovery codes:
    - The rate-limit slot is consumed before the code is checked.
    - A code cannot be used twice concurrently.
    - Recovery codes are stored as salted scrypt hashes; old codes still verify.
  - Other:
    - Magic links last 10 minutes.
    - scrypt is `N=2^16, r=8, p=2`, and old hashes are rehashed at login.
    - Logout sends `Clear-Site-Data: "cache", "storage"`.
    - Step-up, recovery-code use and regeneration, and password removal are audited.
  
  **Authorization**
  - Grant validity was never enforced: `validity` was mis-parsed, so grants with an end date never expired. They now do, fail-closed.
  - Membership `expires_at` is enforced everywhere: request middleware, permissions, `/me`, and the last-owner count. An owner membership cannot carry an expiry. Only an owner can edit another owner.
  - Access rows expire at the earliest of these dates:
    - grant end;
    - accreditation age-out;
    - attestation expiry;
    - membership expiry.
  - Sharing one data-room document no longer grants its folder. The server derives every rule's path from the resource: grants, policies, invites and share links.
    - A client path that doesn't match gets 400 `resource_path_mismatch`.
    - An unknown or foreign id gets 404 `unknown_resource`.
    - A data-room trigger and one-off repair clear over-broad document rule paths already stored.
  - `ip_allowlist`:
    - Malformed entries (`10.0.0.0/`) are ignored fail-closed and rejected by the API.
    - Entries match per address family, so `::/0` no longer admits IPv4.
  - Two owners demoting each other concurrently can no longer leave a workspace without an owner.
  
  **Browser**
  - Zero CSP violations on the key screens (sonner, input-otp, Radix Select and Dialog, TipTap and Zod no longer inject un-nonced styles or `new Function`).
  - Headers:
    - `worker-src 'none'`.
    - CORP is `same-origin` on app, admin and api, `cross-origin` on the embed loader and email chart images, and `same-site` on framed `/embed/*`.
    - Every tenant 404 now carries security headers.
  - Trusted Types stays report-only: `trusted-types default ProseMirrorClipboard`.
  - `Reporting-Endpoints` is an absolute URL.
  - `/csp-report` streams under a 16 KiB limit and accepts `application/reports+json`. Reports are normalised without queries or ids and counted in `fundroom_csp_violations_total`.
  - `/.well-known/security.txt` (`SECURITY_TXT`, `SECURITY_TXT_CONTACT`, `SECURITY_TXT_POLICY`) is served, and `/security.txt` redirects to it.
  - The SPA works on plain-http origins, where `crypto.randomUUID` is unavailable. Sign-out clears the query cache, and passkey autofill is aborted before an email-code request.
  
  **Operations**
  - `fundroom break-glass open|sql|close|list` is host-operator access past RLS (migration 0015, `seedhost_host` role).
    - It needs a ticket, lasts at most 60 minutes and stays pending until owners are mailed.
    - Statements are vetted by Postgres `PREPARE` and run in a security-definer function that cannot switch roles. They are read-only unless `--write`.
    - Each statement is audited in the tenant chain (hash) and the platform chain (text).
    - Owners are mailed on open and after every write.
    - `sql` output is `row_to_json`, and EXPLAIN and SHOW are not accepted.
  - `fundroom evidence access-reviews|operators|break-glass`, plus a monthly change-management bundle (`evidence.yml`).
  - Faults:
    - A connection reset no longer crashes the process.
    - A black-holed database no longer hangs requests. A client-side query bound follows `statement_timeout`; a timed-out COMMIT raises `ClientTimeoutError` 08007.
    - A failed `begin` no longer leaks a pool slot.
    - S3 has connect and socket timeouts.
  - Update sends retry transient mail failures for 24 h without double-sending. Recipients whose membership lapsed are skipped, and one failing mailbox no longer holds the post out of the archive.
  - `/metrics` and the access log label by route template, so token-bearing paths never appear. `/readyz` shows details only to loopback callers without `TRUST_PROXY`, or with the metrics token.
  - Anonymous `/setup/status` after setup answers only `{ required: false }`. The setup mail probe is limited to the caller's own or staff addresses, needs level 2, and allows 5 per hour.
  - Authorization denials and CSRF rejections are logged as `security.*` events and counted in `fundroom_security_events_total`.
  - Hardening:
    - AES-GCM tag length is pinned.
    - Download filenames are sanitised (RFC 6266/8187).
    - The outbound guard refuses userinfo URLs and IPv6 forms that embed IPv4 or special ranges.
  - OpenAPI `pattern`s no longer carry a leaked `/u` flag.
  
  **Tooling**
  - Toxiproxy fault tests run in the integration suite.
  - `40-csp` real-browser checks run in the a11y job.
  - Stryker on `@fundroom/authz` runs weekly (`break: 95`).
  - A ZAP baseline, passive API scans and a weekly active scan run in `zap.yml`, gated by `.zap/rules.tsv`.
  - k6 profiles live in `load/` (`load.yml`, on demand).
  - `minimumReleaseAge` is 7 days.
  - CODEOWNERS paths are corrected.
