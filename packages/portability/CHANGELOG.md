### Minor Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add accreditation vendor adapters: per-workspace VerifyInvestor.com and Parallel Markets connections, vendor-decided 506(c) verifications with stored certificates, and a verification lifecycle (polling, expiry, reminders, renewal).

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - AI assist, opt-in. The operator configures one model provider (`AI_PROVIDER`:
  `openai-compatible` for a self-hosted Ollama, vLLM or llama.cpp server or a hosted API, or
  `anthropic`; default `none`), and each workspace turns on "Draft with AI" for investor updates and
  "Suggest an answer" for data-room Q&A after acknowledging that provider. AI only produces
  suggestions that staff apply through the normal editors; Q&A suggestions cite only pages the asker
  (and the whole folder audience) can see, with server-verified quotes. New kernel package
  `@fundroom/ai`, two adapters, core migration `0025_ai_assist`, routes under `/api/v1/ai`, per-user,
  in-flight and monthly token budgets, and `/admin/settings/ai`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add API keys and outbound webhooks.
  
  **API keys.** Owners and admins mint scoped `frk_` keys under `/admin/api-keys`. Each key acts as its creator, capped by its scopes, and only on routes whose matrix row is `apiKey: true`; 27 routes accept keys so far. Every other route answers 401 `api_key_not_allowed`. Tokens are stored as sha256 hashes. Rotation has a 0–168 h grace window. Each key is limited to 600 requests a minute, and a workspace can hold at most 50 live keys. Keys record when they were last used, and their creator's departure or erasure revokes them. Audit rows written with a key carry `meta.apiKeyId`. The SDK takes an `apiKey` option.
  
  **Outbound webhooks.** Webhooks are managed under `/admin/webhooks` and cover 17 manifest-declared topics. Deliveries follow the Standard Webhooks format: bodies carry ids only, and session and user ids are stripped. Each delivery is fanned out from the outbox and retried ten times over about 47 h. Failed deliveries can be redelivered from a delivery log. An endpoint is disabled after a 410 or 20 exhausted deliveries.
  
  **Webhook privacy and verification.** Person-level topics are gated by analytics consent, and consent, erasure and subscription are re-checked at every attempt. Signing secrets can be rotated with an overlap window. The SDK exports `verifyWebhook`.
  
  **Configuration and supporting changes.**
  - New config: `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`.
  - `@fundroom/outbound-http` gains `oversizeResponse: "truncate"`.
  - Erasure now locks the member's key rows before the audit chain.
  - Migration: core `0018_api_keys_webhooks`.
  - Developer docs are in `docs/api/`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Per-tenant data residency. A cell is now a complete deployment in one region, with its own database, bucket, job queue, backups and key ring, and a workspace's region is the region of its cell. Without `DIRECTORY_DATABASE_URL` nothing changes for an existing install, except that `data_region` is filled in, the residency page exists and the DPA's data-location annex fills in.
  
  - **Declared region.** `DATA_REGION`, `DATA_REGION_LABEL`, `DATA_REGION_JURISDICTION` and `BACKUP_LOCATION` say where the cell is. Boot adopts them into the cell rows and refuses (prod and staging) a local cell in another region. Core migration `0024_data_residency` enforces one database = one region, derives `workspace.data_region` from the cell, and adds the `relocation` hold. `fundroom cell add` takes `--label` and `--jurisdiction`.
  - **Directory.** `@fundroom/directory` at `DIRECTORY_DATABASE_URL` (needs `CONTROL_PLANE=on`, a declared region, S3 storage and a verified TLS connection in production, or `DIRECTORY_DATABASE_ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED_TLS`) holds cells, slugs, verified hostnames and moves, and no personal data. Slugs and custom hostnames are unique across every cell. A request for a workspace on another cell answers `421 wrong_cell` with `X-Fundroom-Cell`, and a soft-deleted workspace is held but never routed. `fundroom directory status|sync|migrate`. A directory outage never stops a cell from booting or serving its own tenants; only new slug claims answer 503 `directory_unavailable`.
  - **Moves between regions.** `fundroom workspace move <slug> --to <cell-id>`, or the operator console's "Move to another cell", holds the workspace under `relocation`, exports it signed and encrypted, has the target pull and verify it against the source cell's published key, imports it with its holds, plan and subscription, switches the directory from the source under its row lock, and crypto-shreds the source after `MOVE_SOURCE_RETENTION_HOURS`. The workspace is unavailable during the move, and members sign in again afterwards: sessions, factors, API keys, webhooks and vendor connections are not carried. `fundroom move list|cancel`; audit actions `workspace.move_*`.
  - **Residency page.** `GET /api/v1/residency` and Settings → Data residency show the declared region, where each component is (database, jobs, search, analytics, files, backups, email, virus scanning, telemetry), and every sub-processor of the deployment and of the workspace, flagged when outside the region. Staff can read it during a move.
  - **Generated sub-processor list.** Mail, storage and Cloudflare for SaaS adapters declare sub-processor metadata, and every vendor adapter declares a jurisdiction. The `dpa`, `sub-processors` and `privacy-notice` templates (version 2) are filled from them, with a new `{{dataLocation}}` annex and `{{workspaceSubProcessors}}` in the privacy notice. Transfer mechanisms are stated only where the software knows them.
  - **Signup.** `GET /api/v1/signup/regions` feeds a region picker that links to another region's signup page.
  
  Also fixed: the setup wizard, demo seed and workspace import placed new workspaces on the `default` cell whatever `CELL_ID` said. Inbound and outbound trace spans no longer export full URLs: share-link and invite tokens, OAuth codes, presigned links and webhook paths are reduced to the origin. The Helm chart's worker scratch volume was a fixed 64 MiB, which evicted the worker on any larger export; it is now `dataScratchSizeLimit` (default 4 GiB).
  
  Compose and Helm (`residency.*` values) pass every new key through with empty defaults. Docs: runbook `residency.md`; the Cells section of `control-plane.md`; backups per region in `backup-and-restore.md`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add e-signature, the round closing workflow and signed-document vaulting.
  
  **E-signature.** A workspace connects one vendor under `/admin/esign`: Documenso or DocuSeal (cloud or self-hosted), DocuSign or Dropbox Sign, reached over their APIs only. Credentials are sealed per workspace, verified with the vendor before they are stored, and never shown again. Vendor callbacks arrive at `/webhooks/esign/{connectionId}`. They are authenticated per vendor and treated only as a wake-up: the server then asks the vendor for the envelope's status. A five-minute sweep backs them up. Signed PDFs (and the vendor's certificate where separate) are size-capped, scanned and stored encrypted.
  
  **E-sign NDA.** A legal document's ceremony can be click-wrap (default) or e-signature (NDA documents only). Investors record ESIGN consent to electronic records, sign in the vendor's UI (opened top-level, never inside an embed frame), and the completed envelope writes the same acceptance a click-wrap does, so the portal gate and NDA gates on folders and documents open as before.
  
  **Closing workflow.** A round's Closing tab sends subscription documents from a vendor template, prefilled from the round's terms, and tracks each commitment through documents sent, signed, wired and confirmed, with a summary of counts and amounts. Investors see their own checklist and download their signed copy.
  
  **Vaulting.** Completed envelopes are filed into the data room under legal hold, in staff-only folders that no investor, delegate or share-link grant can open.
  
  **Fixes found along the way.**
  - An NDA or accreditation gate on a sub-folder or document now applies to members granted an ancestor folder (it previously did not).
  - The workspace row is now always locked before the audit chain, removing a class of deadlocks between settings, acceptance, group and document writers.
  - The first concurrent use of a new encryption-key purpose no longer fails with an aborted transaction.
  
  **Configuration.** New: `ESIGN_DRIVERS`, `ESIGN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`, `ESIGN_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES`. Migrations: core `0019_esign`, round `0004_closing`, data-room `0004_vault` and `0005_staff_only`, notify `0010_esign_event_types`. Operator guide in `docs/esign/`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Evidence and authz depth. Forensic watermarking: a per-document `forensic`
  protection embeds an invisible, keyed mark unique to each recipient in every served page image, and
  staff with `data-room.forensics` can test a leaked image against everyone who received that version
  ("Trace a leak"); downloads carry a trace code. Share-link `forceWatermark` is now enforced. External
  audit anchoring: a daily RFC 6962 Merkle root over all checkpoints is time-stamped by RFC 3161 TSAs
  and/or logged in Sigstore Rekor v2 (`AUDIT_ANCHOR_DRIVERS`), with per-checkpoint proofs, export
  bundle v2 and `fundroom audit anchor|verify-anchor`. An optional OpenFGA engine behind the authz
  port (`AUTHZ_ENGINE=openfga`, shadow or enforce; enforce can only narrow Postgres' answer). Core
  migration `0026_evidence_authz`, data-room `0007_forensic`. Also fixes a Postgres rebuild bug where a
  document-level rule hid capabilities inherited from its folder.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add the integrations hub.
  
  **Connections.** `/admin/integrations` lists every integration a workspace can use. A workspace holds at most one live connection per provider. Credentials are sealed per workspace and never shown again. Each connection reports its health (active, degraded, reconnect needed) with the last success and the last problem. QuickBooks Online, Xero and Slack connect over OAuth 2.0, using client credentials the operator registers once per deployment. The member who started a connection must confirm it from their own session before it is saved. Stripe connects with a restricted key (`rk_…`); secret keys are refused.
  
  **KPI sources.** Monthly revenue, expenses, net income and cash come from QuickBooks or Xero. Gross volume, net volume, new customers, MRR and active subscriptions come from Stripe. A monthly metric is bound to one source series under **KPI sources**. A nightly sync backfills 24 months and then keeps the last 3 current. A synced value never silently replaces one typed by hand: it is flagged for review.
  
  **Slack app.** Notification channels can post through the connected Slack app to a channel picked from a list, alongside the existing incoming-webhook channels. Staff are alerted when a connection stops working.
  
  **Booking.** The investor portal shows "Book time" links (Calendly or Cal.com) to the audiences you choose. Bookings made through a connected account are recorded and logged as meetings on the CRM contact.
  
  **Cap table.** New optional module `captable`. It imports read-only snapshots from our CSV template or from a Carta or Pulley export, and shows a fully diluted summary by class, the option pool and SAFEs/notes outstanding. Investors see a "Your holdings" card with their own lines under a disclaimer; published snapshots are immutable.
  
  **Configuration.** New: `INTEGRATIONS_QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`/`_ENVIRONMENT`, `INTEGRATIONS_XERO_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`, `INTEGRATIONS_SLACK_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`, `INTEGRATIONS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`. Migrations: core `0020_integrations`, metrics `0005_kpi_source_kinds` and `0006_kpi_bindings`, notify `0011_slack_app_channels`, crm `0002_activity`, captable `0001_captable`. Operator guide in `docs/integrations/`.
  
  **Fix.** Job workers no longer run more concurrent slots per queue than the database pool has connections (`DATABASE_POOL_MAX`), so a small pool is no longer starved by pollers ahead of requests.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add search, workspace export and import, accessibility and i18n coverage.
  
  - **Search.** `GET /api/v1/search` and a search box in the portal and admin headers (`/` or Ctrl/Cmd+K).
    - The index covers data-room documents and folders (with extracted PDF text), published content-page sections and sent updates.
    - Access is filtered on every query by row security plus an authz check per document. A gated document is findable by its title only; nothing in the response depends on its body.
    - Queries are lexed by Postgres's own parser, so emails, file names, decimals and hyphenated dates are found as written.
    - `fundroom search reindex` rebuilds the index, and a 10-minute sweep rebuilds it by itself after deploys and imports.
  - **Workspace export.**
    - `/admin/settings/export` (owner, step-up) and `fundroom workspace export` produce a signed, streamed zip. It holds every table as JSONL, the audit chain, and every document in plaintext.
    - Exports are stored encrypted, expire after seven days, and can be checked offline with `fundroom workspace verify-export`.
  - **Workspace import.**
    - `fundroom workspace import <file> --slug <new>` recreates the workspace with fresh ids.
    - Members are matched to existing accounts by email, and blobs are re-encrypted under the new workspace's keys. Search and access are rebuilt afterwards.
    - It refuses unsigned files unless `--allow-unverified` is given, along with malformed archives and any file that names objects or rows of another workspace.
  - **Accessibility.**
    - The data-room viewer is keyboard-complete: zoom keys, go to page, a roving toolbar, a `?` shortcut sheet and thumbnails for every page. Each page has a screen-reader text layer (`GET /data-room/documents/{id}/pages/{n}/text`).
    - A public `/accessibility` statement is served per workspace.
    - A new `a11y` CI job runs real-browser axe (WCAG 2.2 AA including contrast) on 16 key pages for every pull request.
    - The muted text colour now meets 4.5:1 everywhere.
  - **i18n.**
    - An `en-XA` pseudo-locale proves the investor UI has no hard-coded English, and `pnpm lint:i18n` enforces that for every future change.
    - The UI package has no English defaults, messages use real plurals, and emails render in the recipient's language.
    - Users choose their language in settings (`PUT /me/locale`), and admins set a workspace default (`PUT /workspace/locale`).
  - **Fixes.**
    - Database pools now log idle-connection errors instead of crashing the process.
    - Three GitHub workflows used `hashFiles` in job-level conditions, which GitHub rejects, so they never started. They are fixed, and a new actionlint check keeps them that way.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add staff single sign-on and SCIM provisioning: one OIDC or SAML connection per workspace with verified domains, just-in-time staff accounts, workspace-bound SSO sessions and optional enforcement with owner break-glass, plus a SCIM 2.0 endpoint that provisions staff memberships and maps IdP groups to roles.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Close the v1.0 carry-overs. Investors can add delegates (scope: everything, data room only, or updates only) from portal settings, and admins can add or remove them from a person's page. A delegate borrows a scoped subset of its investor's access, is bound by both its investor's exclusions and its own, signs its own gates, and loses everything as soon as its investor's access ends. Sign-in now refuses a person whose every membership has expired (`membership_expired`, after the credential is proven). The last-owner floor counts only active, unexpired owners and every owner-removing path locks first. Invite grants and imported rule paths are re-derived from the resource, so a folder move or an old over-broad path can no longer widen access. A daily job reminds `access.manage` holders about overdue access reviews. Trusted Types is enforced by default (`CSP_TRUSTED_TYPES`), the HIBP check's failure mode is configurable and audited (`AUTH_HIBP_FAIL_MODE`), web source maps are no longer served, module raw routes run the kernel guards, and a behavioural authz sweep checks every route against the matrix. Fixes the post-sign-in "no access" screen caused by a stale bootstrap cache. Migrations: core `0017_delegates`; notify `0007`, `0008`; round `0003`; metrics `0004`; content `0003`; updates `0003`.

### Patch Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - The product is now called **FundRoom**, step 1 of the rename: what people
  see. `INSTANCE_NAME` and `PASSKEY_RP_NAME` default to `FundRoom`; emails, the setup banner, the
  "Powered by" line, SDK and embed error messages, export and audit-bundle READMEs and docs say
  FundRoom; the mail default accent is the app primary `#1d4ed8` (was `#1f4b99`); a new interim mark
  ships as `favicon.svg`, PNG icons and `site.webmanifest`; outbound `User-Agent` is
  `FundRoom/<version>`. The image is `ghcr.io/fundroomhq/fundroom` and the Helm chart is
  `deploy/helm/fundroom` (`oci://ghcr.io/fundroomhq/charts/fundroom`; its selector labels change, so
  reinstall a release made from a local checkout of the old chart). PaaS templates name their
  services `fundroom*`, dev hosts are `*.fundroom.localhost`, the security contact is
  `security@fundroom.com` and the update index defaults to `https://releases.fundroom.com/index.json`.
  The WordPress plugin is displayed as FundRoom; its slug and text domain stay `seed-host`.
  Identifiers (`@seed-host/*`, the `seedhost` CLI, `SEEDHOST_*`, `_seedhost-challenge`, headers,
  meters, metrics) are renamed with aliases in the next step. Cryptographic labels and export format
  ids never change.
