### Minor Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add search, workspace export and import, accessibility and i18n coverage.
  
  - **Search.** `GET /api/v1/search` and a search box in the portal and admin headers (`/` or Ctrl/Cmd+K).
    - The index covers data-room documents and folders (with extracted PDF text), published content-page sections and sent updates.
    - Access is filtered on every query by row security plus an authz check per document. A gated document is findable by its title only; nothing in the response depends on its body.
    - Queries are lexed by Postgres's own parser, so emails, file names, decimals and hyphenated dates are found as written.
    - `fundroom search reindex` rebuilds the index, and a 10-minute sweep rebuilds it by itself after deploys and imports.
  - **Workspace export.**
    - `/admin/settings/export` (owner, step-up) and `fundroom workspace export` produce a signed, streamed zip. It holds every table as JSONL, the audit chain, and every document in plaintext.
    - Exports are stored encrypted, expire after seven days, and can be checked offline with `fundroom workspace verify-export`.
  - **Workspace import.**
    - `fundroom workspace import <file> --slug <new>` recreates the workspace with fresh ids.
    - Members are matched to existing accounts by email, and blobs are re-encrypted under the new workspace's keys. Search and access are rebuilt afterwards.
    - It refuses unsigned files unless `--allow-unverified` is given, along with malformed archives and any file that names objects or rows of another workspace.
  - **Accessibility.**
    - The data-room viewer is keyboard-complete: zoom keys, go to page, a roving toolbar, a `?` shortcut sheet and thumbnails for every page. Each page has a screen-reader text layer (`GET /data-room/documents/{id}/pages/{n}/text`).
    - A public `/accessibility` statement is served per workspace.
    - A new `a11y` CI job runs real-browser axe (WCAG 2.2 AA including contrast) on 16 key pages for every pull request.
    - The muted text colour now meets 4.5:1 everywhere.
  - **i18n.**
    - An `en-XA` pseudo-locale proves the investor UI has no hard-coded English, and `pnpm lint:i18n` enforces that for every future change.
    - The UI package has no English defaults, messages use real plurals, and emails render in the recipient's language.
    - Users choose their language in settings (`PUT /me/locale`), and admins set a workspace default (`PUT /workspace/locale`).
  - **Fixes.**
    - Database pools now log idle-connection errors instead of crashing the process.
    - Three GitHub workflows used `hashFiles` in job-level conditions, which GitHub rejects, so they never started. They are fixed, and a new actionlint check keeps them that way.

### Patch Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add e-signature, the round closing workflow and signed-document vaulting.
  
  **E-signature.** A workspace connects one vendor under `/admin/esign`: Documenso or DocuSeal (cloud or self-hosted), DocuSign or Dropbox Sign, reached over their APIs only. Credentials are sealed per workspace, verified with the vendor before they are stored, and never shown again. Vendor callbacks arrive at `/webhooks/esign/{connectionId}`. They are authenticated per vendor and treated only as a wake-up: the server then asks the vendor for the envelope's status. A five-minute sweep backs them up. Signed PDFs (and the vendor's certificate where separate) are size-capped, scanned and stored encrypted.
  
  **E-sign NDA.** A legal document's ceremony can be click-wrap (default) or e-signature (NDA documents only). Investors record ESIGN consent to electronic records, sign in the vendor's UI (opened top-level, never inside an embed frame), and the completed envelope writes the same acceptance a click-wrap does, so the portal gate and NDA gates on folders and documents open as before.
  
  **Closing workflow.** A round's Closing tab sends subscription documents from a vendor template, prefilled from the round's terms, and tracks each commitment through documents sent, signed, wired and confirmed, with a summary of counts and amounts. Investors see their own checklist and download their signed copy.
  
  **Vaulting.** Completed envelopes are filed into the data room under legal hold, in staff-only folders that no investor, delegate or share-link grant can open.
  
  **Fixes found along the way.**
  - An NDA or accreditation gate on a sub-folder or document now applies to members granted an ancestor folder (it previously did not).
  - The workspace row is now always locked before the audit chain, removing a class of deadlocks between settings, acceptance, group and document writers.
  - The first concurrent use of a new encryption-key purpose no longer fails with an aborted transaction.
  
  **Configuration.** New: `ESIGN_DRIVERS`, `ESIGN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`, `ESIGN_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES`. Migrations: core `0019_esign`, round `0004_closing`, data-room `0004_vault` and `0005_staff_only`, notify `0010_esign_event_types`. Operator guide in `docs/esign/`.
