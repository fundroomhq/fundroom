# @fundroomhq/ui

## 1.0.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Publish the design system to npm. The new `@fundroomhq/tokens` package holds the DTCG source (`fundroom.tokens.json`, moved from `packages/ui/tokens/`) and the generated `tokens.css` (moved from `packages/ui/src/styles/`; only its header comment changed, because the source path moved). `@fundroomhq/ui` depends on it, imports its CSS, and keeps its `./tokens.css` and `./tokens.json` exports. Both packages are now public, in the fixed group, and published by the `Release` workflow after the image, at the release version, with npm provenance through trusted publishing: `next` for release candidates, `latest` for stable releases; a re-run skips a version already on npm. The registry also gives a package's first version the `latest` tag, so `latest` stays on `1.0.0-rc.0` until the first stable release. Packing (install and build, no credentials) and publishing (only `npm view` and `npm publish`, with the OIDC token) are separate jobs. The published `@fundroomhq/ui/styles.css` needs no monorepo paths: its `@source` points at the package's own `dist/`, so a Tailwind v4 app gets the component classes from one `@import`. `tw-animate-css` moved to `dependencies` and `tailwindcss` ^4 is a peer dependency. `pnpm packages:pack-check` (also in CI) packs both, checks the tarball contract and ui's file list, and builds a Vite + Tailwind v4 + React 19 page from the tarballs. The root `release` script (`changeset publish`) is gone: publishing happens only in the workflow.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add the admin surfaces.
  
  - **Audit log.** Filterable, paginated log with chain verification. The signed export is an Ed25519-signed zip holding JSONL, CSV and checkpoints, and `fundroom audit verify-export` checks it offline. That command exits 3 when the bundle's origin is not pinned to a trusted key.
  - **Access review.** A report covering activity, gates and accreditation-window divergence. The reviewer attests to the report they saw, and its canonical JSON is stored as evidence.
  - **Sessions admin.** Admins can list and revoke a member's sessions in this workspace.
  - **View as investor.** A read-only view of the portal with a banner, audited start and end, and read-only database transactions.
  - **Danger zones.** Transfer ownership, revoke all sessions and delete workspace, each needing typed confirmation and step-up. Delete is a soft delete with a 30-day restore window (`fundroom workspace restore`) and a nightly crypto-shred purge.
  - **Data subject requests.** Access and rectification requests alongside erasure. A subject export bundle collects data through a per-module `dsar.export` hook. Identity erasure runs as the last step.
  - **Settings and operations.** Module settings pages through a new `admin.settings` slot. A jobs/dead-letter page (`fundroom jobs dlq`) and `/api/v1/ops/health` with custom-domain certificate expiry.
  - **Pool-deadlock fixes.** Removed three pool deadlocks: `legal.isErased`/`allowsPurpose` from an investor context, and two in the updates module (replies and the archive read).

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - The vocabulary, the identity half and the in-frame runtime of the iframe embed.
  
  `@fundroom/domain` gains the `embed` block of `core.workspace.settings` — exact origins, the builder-preview toggle, `trustHostIdentity`, and the registered Ed25519 handoff keys — plus the pure rules over it: `normalizeEmbedOrigin` (an `https://` origin with no path, query, fragment or credentials; `http://` on loopback only, because a `Secure; Partitioned` cookie cannot be set from a plain-http page at all), `embedFrameAncestors`, `isAllowedEmbedOrigin` and `originMatchesPattern`. A customer-entered origin may not contain a wildcard. The only wildcards in the product are six curated builder-preview origins behind one boolean, because `https://*.acme.com` reads as a convenience and means "trust every host anyone ever puts in this zone", including the stale staging box and the subdomain-takeover target — and nobody reads an allow-list entry that way while writing it. There is no embed key: `/embed/<slug>` already names the workspace, the slug is already public through `<slug>.<canonical>` and `/w/<slug>`, and a public identifier that gates nothing is either theatre or a rotation lever that breaks snippets a customer pasted into pages they no longer remember. It lives in settings rather than a table because `frame-ancestors` is resolved before the handler on every embed request and `ResolvedWorkspace` already carries `settings`, so the list costs no query and has no cache to invalidate — which also means this epic adds no migration.
  
  `@fundroom/contracts` adds the embed operations and widens `ConsentPutBody.source` to include `host_cmp`. That value has been legal in the *stored* consent enum since E1.6 and was missing only from the request, so an embed could record a host CMP's answer only by claiming the member chose it in their own settings — a false statement in a register whose entire purpose is to record who consented to what, and where. `SlugSchema` now refuses version-shaped slugs, which the embed loader's URL space reserves.
  
  `@fundroom/identity` verifies host-signed handoff assertions: compact JWS, EdDSA only, the key selected by `kid` from the workspace's registered list and only then verified — the token's own `alg` is checked, never consulted, which is how JWT verifiers get broken. `aud` must equal the workspace slug, `exp - iat` at most 60 s, `iat` within a 5-second skew allowance, `sub` a valid email, `iss` a bare https origin, and `jti` inside the charset the caller's replay claim can carry. Every key registered under a `kid` is tried, because two rows sharing one is the *normal* rotation shape and stopping at the first match failed every login until an operator noticed. `handoffWireReason` collapses `unknown_key` and `bad_signature` for the response while the precise reason still reaches the audit log: telling them apart on a public endpoint lets a prober enumerate which key ids a workspace has registered. Only the public half of a key is ever stored, so there is no secret of ours at rest and a database compromise cannot mint an assertion.
  
  `@fundroom/web` completes the in-frame runtime: `consent`, `handoff`, `logout` and `viewport` inbound, `event`, `scroll-to` and the previously-typed-but-never-posted `open-external` outbound, all tolerating unknown message types so a snippet in someone else's CMS keeps working against a newer portal. Consent is `granted = analytics && !gpc` — a host CMP can never turn measurement on over a GPC signal, and the server independently enforces the same thing so the two cannot disagree. A reusable top-level-popup helper lands with step-up as its first caller; the flows that *complete* in a popup arrive with E2.3. Plus the admin Embed screen: origins with the same validation as the server, the preview toggle with a warning naming what it costs, the derived `frame-ancestors` shown read-only, the registered keys, and a snippet generator that emits exactly what `docs/embed/quickstart.md` documents.
  
  `@fundroomhq/ui` takes `DialogContent`'s vertical offset from a `--sh-dialog-top` custom property defaulting to today's `10vmin`. Inside an embed the loader sizes the frame to its content, so the frame never scrolls and the host page does: a dialog opened by a reader 2 500 px down landed 10vmin from the top of the *document*, overlay greying out the page and focus off-screen. The property is set from the `viewport` message the loader posts; with no loader — a hand-pasted `<iframe>` — nothing changes.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add search, workspace export and import, accessibility and i18n coverage.
  
  - **Search.** `GET /api/v1/search` and a search box in the portal and admin headers (`/` or Ctrl/Cmd+K).
    - The index covers data-room documents and folders (with extracted PDF text), published content-page sections and sent updates.
    - Access is filtered on every query by row security plus an authz check per document. A gated document is findable by its title only; nothing in the response depends on its body.
    - Queries are lexed by Postgres's own parser, so emails, file names, decimals and hyphenated dates are found as written.
    - `fundroom search reindex` rebuilds the index, and a 10-minute sweep rebuilds it by itself after deploys and imports.
  - **Workspace export.**
    - `/admin/settings/export` (owner, step-up) and `fundroom workspace export` produce a signed, streamed zip. It holds every table as JSONL, the audit chain, and every document in plaintext.
    - Exports are stored encrypted, expire after seven days, and can be checked offline with `fundroom workspace verify-export`.
  - **Workspace import.**
    - `fundroom workspace import <file> --slug <new>` recreates the workspace with fresh ids.
    - Members are matched to existing accounts by email, and blobs are re-encrypted under the new workspace's keys. Search and access are rebuilt afterwards.
    - It refuses unsigned files unless `--allow-unverified` is given, along with malformed archives and any file that names objects or rows of another workspace.
  - **Accessibility.**
    - The data-room viewer is keyboard-complete: zoom keys, go to page, a roving toolbar, a `?` shortcut sheet and thumbnails for every page. Each page has a screen-reader text layer (`GET /data-room/documents/{id}/pages/{n}/text`).
    - A public `/accessibility` statement is served per workspace.
    - A new `a11y` CI job runs real-browser axe (WCAG 2.2 AA including contrast) on 16 key pages for every pull request.
    - The muted text colour now meets 4.5:1 everywhere.
  - **i18n.**
    - An `en-XA` pseudo-locale proves the investor UI has no hard-coded English, and `pnpm lint:i18n` enforces that for every future change.
    - The UI package has no English defaults, messages use real plurals, and emails render in the recipient's language.
    - Users choose their language in settings (`PUT /me/locale`), and admins set a workspace default (`PUT /workspace/locale`).
  - **Fixes.**
    - Database pools now log idle-connection errors instead of crashing the process.
    - Three GitHub workflows used `hashFiles` in job-level conditions, which GitHub rejects, so they never started. They are fixed, and a new actionlint check keeps them that way.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Close the v1.0 carry-overs. Investors can add delegates (scope: everything, data room only, or updates only) from portal settings, and admins can add or remove them from a person's page. A delegate borrows a scoped subset of its investor's access, is bound by both its investor's exclusions and its own, signs its own gates, and loses everything as soon as its investor's access ends. Sign-in now refuses a person whose every membership has expired (`membership_expired`, after the credential is proven). The last-owner floor counts only active, unexpired owners and every owner-removing path locks first. Invite grants and imported rule paths are re-derived from the resource, so a folder move or an old over-broad path can no longer widen access. A daily job reminds `access.manage` holders about overdue access reviews. Trusted Types is enforced by default (`CSP_TRUSTED_TYPES`), the HIBP check's failure mode is configurable and audited (`AUTH_HIBP_FAIL_MODE`), web source maps are no longer served, module raw routes run the kernel guards, and a behavioural authz sweep checks every route against the matrix. Fixes the post-sign-in "no access" screen caused by a stale bootstrap cache. Migrations: core `0017_delegates`; notify `0007`, `0008`; round `0003`; metrics `0004`; content `0003`; updates `0003`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add the design system and the web app shell. `@fundroomhq/ui` ships DTCG tokens rendered to `--sh-*` custom properties, a Tailwind v4 theme that maps shadcn variable names onto them, light/dark/system theming, shadcn-style React 19 components (buttons, forms, OTP input, cards, alerts, dialogs, menus, tabs, tables, toasts, layout shell, empty/error/loading states), a runtime theming API (`@fundroomhq/ui/theme`) and Storybook with the axe addon. `@fundroom/web` is the Vite + React 19 + TanStack Router SPA: investor, admin and embed route trees driven by the `/api/v1/modules` bootstrap, sign-in with email code, magic link, passkeys (including conditional UI), password and OIDC, step-up, invite landing, session/device/passkey/TOTP/password settings, the embed cookie probe and postMessage bridge, Paraglide i18n (`en`). `@fundroom/server` now serves the built SPA from `WEB_DIST_PATH` as a per-request template: CSP nonce substitution, base-path URL rewriting, and an injected `seed-host:config` meta carrying the router base, API base, route tree, workspace and auth methods.

### Patch Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Security hardening, following an ASVS 5.0 Level 2 review and an internal penetration test.
  
  **Upgrading: production and staging now refuse to boot on settings they used to accept.** Each error names its fix, and `docs/runbooks/install-and-upgrade.md` has an "Upgrading to the security-hardening release" section.
  1. `AV_DRIVER=noop` needs `AV_ACCEPT_UNSCANNED=true`, or run ClamAV (`AV_DRIVER=clamd`).
     - Helm: set `config.av.acceptUnscanned`.
     - PaaS services created from an older template: add the variable to web and worker.
  2. SMTP to a public relay needs `smtps://…:465` or `?requireTLS=true`.
     - Refused: `tls.rejectUnauthorized` set to anything but `true`, a truthy `ignoreTLS`, a repeated option, and backslashes or spaces in the URL.
  3. A public database host needs `sslmode=verify-full` or `verify-ca`.
     - The last `sslmode` in the URL wins, and a `host=` parameter counts as the host.
     - For a private CA, add `sslrootcert=`. Helm: `postgresql.external.caSecret`.
     - `DATABASE_ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED_TLS=true` is only for a host that really is private.
  4. `METRICS_ENABLED=true` needs `METRICS_TOKEN`. Without either, `/metrics` is off in prod. Caddy now refuses `/metrics` unless `EDGE_EXPOSE_METRICS=true`.
  5. Compose requires `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. An existing stack whose `.env` never set it was created with `seedhost`: set that, then rotate the password.
  6. `RATE_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER` (new, for k6 and ZAP runs) other than 1 is refused in prod, and whenever `APP_ENV` is not set explicitly.
  7. Client IP:
     - `TRUST_PROXY=true` now means one trusted hop counted from the right of `X-Forwarded-For`. `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` sets more hops, and `CLIENT_IP_HEADER` names a platform header. The Fly, Render and Railway templates set one.
     - `X-Forwarded-Host` and `-Proto` take their rightmost entry.
     - Caddy trusts forwarded headers only from `EDGE_TRUSTED_PROXIES`, default loopback. Behind a CDN or load balancer, set it and `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS=2`.
  8. HSTS:
     - `includeSubDomains` can be sent without `preload` (`HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`).
     - `includeSubDomains` and `preload` go only to the `BASE_URL` host and its subdomains, so customers' custom domains get plain `max-age`.
  
  **Authentication and sessions**
  - Managing a second factor needs the second factor.
    - Once a user has a TOTP or a passkey, disabling or enrolling TOTP, adding or removing a passkey, regenerating recovery codes, and setting or removing a password all need auth level 2 plus a recent sign-in.
    - A PIN-less passkey step-up in the same session also counts.
    - Every factor change signs out the user's other sessions and emails a security notice. Previously, someone holding a mailbox could replace an owner's second factor.
  - Session tokens:
    - The session token rotates on step-up and on login (the previous session is revoked, including share-link and embed logins).
    - Concurrent step-ups keep the winner's token.
  - Passwords:
    - Changing or removing an existing password needs `currentPassword`.
    - Signing out other sessions needs a recent sign-in.
  - OIDC:
    - Logins are level 1 unless the ID token's `amr`/`acr` shows MFA (`OIDC_MFA_ACR`) or `OIDC_TRUST_MFA=true`.
    - The flow is bound to the starting browser (`__Host-oidc_req`).
    - The ID-token signature is verified.
    - `returnTo` must be same-origin, inside `BASE_PATH`.
  - Sign-in answers the same for known and unknown addresses, including while mail is failing.
    - `/auth/otp/start` and `/auth/magic-link/start` no longer answer 503. Failures are logged as `auth.sign_in_mail_failed`.
    - Unknown addresses get a decoy challenge. Challenges are deleted 6 h after expiry.
  - TOTP and recovery codes:
    - The rate-limit slot is consumed before the code is checked.
    - A code cannot be used twice concurrently.
    - Recovery codes are stored as salted scrypt hashes; old codes still verify.
  - Other:
    - Magic links last 10 minutes.
    - scrypt is `N=2^16, r=8, p=2`, and old hashes are rehashed at login.
    - Logout sends `Clear-Site-Data: "cache", "storage"`.
    - Step-up, recovery-code use and regeneration, and password removal are audited.
  
  **Authorization**
  - Grant validity was never enforced: `validity` was mis-parsed, so grants with an end date never expired. They now do, fail-closed.
  - Membership `expires_at` is enforced everywhere: request middleware, permissions, `/me`, and the last-owner count. An owner membership cannot carry an expiry. Only an owner can edit another owner.
  - Access rows expire at the earliest of these dates:
    - grant end;
    - accreditation age-out;
    - attestation expiry;
    - membership expiry.
  - Sharing one data-room document no longer grants its folder. The server derives every rule's path from the resource: grants, policies, invites and share links.
    - A client path that doesn't match gets 400 `resource_path_mismatch`.
    - An unknown or foreign id gets 404 `unknown_resource`.
    - A data-room trigger and one-off repair clear over-broad document rule paths already stored.
  - `ip_allowlist`:
    - Malformed entries (`10.0.0.0/`) are ignored fail-closed and rejected by the API.
    - Entries match per address family, so `::/0` no longer admits IPv4.
  - Two owners demoting each other concurrently can no longer leave a workspace without an owner.
  
  **Browser**
  - Zero CSP violations on the key screens (sonner, input-otp, Radix Select and Dialog, TipTap and Zod no longer inject un-nonced styles or `new Function`).
  - Headers:
    - `worker-src 'none'`.
    - CORP is `same-origin` on app, admin and api, `cross-origin` on the embed loader and email chart images, and `same-site` on framed `/embed/*`.
    - Every tenant 404 now carries security headers.
  - Trusted Types stays report-only: `trusted-types default ProseMirrorClipboard`.
  - `Reporting-Endpoints` is an absolute URL.
  - `/csp-report` streams under a 16 KiB limit and accepts `application/reports+json`. Reports are normalised without queries or ids and counted in `fundroom_csp_violations_total`.
  - `/.well-known/security.txt` (`SECURITY_TXT`, `SECURITY_TXT_CONTACT`, `SECURITY_TXT_POLICY`) is served, and `/security.txt` redirects to it.
  - The SPA works on plain-http origins, where `crypto.randomUUID` is unavailable. Sign-out clears the query cache, and passkey autofill is aborted before an email-code request.
  
  **Operations**
  - `fundroom break-glass open|sql|close|list` is host-operator access past RLS (migration 0015, `seedhost_host` role).
    - It needs a ticket, lasts at most 60 minutes and stays pending until owners are mailed.
    - Statements are vetted by Postgres `PREPARE` and run in a security-definer function that cannot switch roles. They are read-only unless `--write`.
    - Each statement is audited in the tenant chain (hash) and the platform chain (text).
    - Owners are mailed on open and after every write.
    - `sql` output is `row_to_json`, and EXPLAIN and SHOW are not accepted.
  - `fundroom evidence access-reviews|operators|break-glass`, plus a monthly change-management bundle (`evidence.yml`).
  - Faults:
    - A connection reset no longer crashes the process.
    - A black-holed database no longer hangs requests. A client-side query bound follows `statement_timeout`; a timed-out COMMIT raises `ClientTimeoutError` 08007.
    - A failed `begin` no longer leaks a pool slot.
    - S3 has connect and socket timeouts.
  - Update sends retry transient mail failures for 24 h without double-sending. Recipients whose membership lapsed are skipped, and one failing mailbox no longer holds the post out of the archive.
  - `/metrics` and the access log label by route template, so token-bearing paths never appear. `/readyz` shows details only to loopback callers without `TRUST_PROXY`, or with the metrics token.
  - Anonymous `/setup/status` after setup answers only `{ required: false }`. The setup mail probe is limited to the caller's own or staff addresses, needs level 2, and allows 5 per hour.
  - Authorization denials and CSRF rejections are logged as `security.*` events and counted in `fundroom_security_events_total`.
  - Hardening:
    - AES-GCM tag length is pinned.
    - Download filenames are sanitised (RFC 6266/8187).
    - The outbound guard refuses userinfo URLs and IPv6 forms that embed IPv4 or special ranges.
  - OpenAPI `pattern`s no longer carry a leaked `/u` flag.
  
  **Tooling**
  - Toxiproxy fault tests run in the integration suite.
  - `40-csp` real-browser checks run in the a11y job.
  - Stryker on `@fundroom/authz` runs weekly (`break: 95`).
  - A ZAP baseline, passive API scans and a weekly active scan run in `zap.yml`, gated by `.zap/rules.tsv`.
  - k6 profiles live in `load/` (`load.yml`, on demand).
  - `minimumReleaseAge` is 7 days.
  - CODEOWNERS paths are corrected.
- Updated dependencies [[`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b)]:
  - @fundroomhq/tokens@1.0.0-rc.0
