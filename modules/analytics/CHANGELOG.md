### Minor Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add the admin surfaces.
  
  - **Audit log.** Filterable, paginated log with chain verification. The signed export is an Ed25519-signed zip holding JSONL, CSV and checkpoints, and `fundroom audit verify-export` checks it offline. That command exits 3 when the bundle's origin is not pinned to a trusted key.
  - **Access review.** A report covering activity, gates and accreditation-window divergence. The reviewer attests to the report they saw, and its canonical JSON is stored as evidence.
  - **Sessions admin.** Admins can list and revoke a member's sessions in this workspace.
  - **View as investor.** A read-only view of the portal with a banner, audited start and end, and read-only database transactions.
  - **Danger zones.** Transfer ownership, revoke all sessions and delete workspace, each needing typed confirmation and step-up. Delete is a soft delete with a 30-day restore window (`fundroom workspace restore`) and a nightly crypto-shred purge.
  - **Data subject requests.** Access and rectification requests alongside erasure. A subject export bundle collects data through a per-module `dsar.export` hook. Identity erasure runs as the last step.
  - **Settings and operations.** Module settings pages through a new `admin.settings` slot. A jobs/dead-letter page (`fundroom jobs dlq`) and `/api/v1/ops/health` with custom-domain certificate expiry.
  - **Pool-deadlock fixes.** Removed three pool deadlocks: `legal.isErased`/`allowsPurpose` from an investor context, and two in the updates module (replies and the archive read).

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Analytics and notifications, full.
  
  **Email delivery feedback.** Three ESP adapters — `@fundroom/email-resend`, `@fundroom/email-postmark` and `@fundroom/email-ses` (`MAILER_DRIVER=resend|postmark|ses`) — send over dedicated guarded HTTP clients and verify their webhooks: Svix signatures for Resend, Basic auth for Postmark, SNS message signatures for SES with the certificate URL, topic ARN and subscription URL pinned. `MailerPort` gains `stream`, `tracking`, `ref`, `capabilities`, `open`/`click` event kinds and `MailSuppressedError`. The kernel records every workspace message it sends in `core.mail_message`, accepts provider webhooks at `/webhooks/email/<driver>`, and publishes `mail.delivery_recorded` into the right workspace. Opens and clicks are published only in `engagement` mode for members whose `email_tracking` consent allows it, checked again when the webhook arrives. `classifyEngagement` flags Apple Mail Privacy Protection, link scanners and opens with no user agent as automated. A hard bounce, complaint or provider-side suppression suppresses the address for that workspace's broadcast and notification mail, never for sign-in mail. The list is stored as a keyed hash that survives key rotation and is managed at `/admin/mail`. Update sends report delivered, bounced and complained.
  
  **Engagement analytics.** Per-document page heatmaps, per-update opens and clicks (human and automated reported separately), a consented, engagement-mode hot list with a CSV export and `analytics.hot_lead` alerts, per-workspace retention including per-member rollups, and a transparency notice that names email opens, clicks and engagement scoring.
  
  **Consent and erasure.** `legal.privacyRegion` suggests a consent mode (EU opt-in, UK opt-out, US notice-only) when it is set, and never rewrites a mode an admin chose. Global Privacy Control is now stored as a refusal, so it also covers facts that arrive without a browser. `legal.legalHold` blocks erasure and retention. DSAR erasure requests (`/compliance/erasure-requests`) carry a statutory due date and complete once every module that holds personal data has erased its own rows. That includes modules that are currently disabled.
  
  **Notifications.** Daily and weekly digests in each member's own time zone, catch-up after a missed run, quiet hours that hold emails but never the in-app inbox, an inbox with paging, archiving and mark-all-read, and Slack channels through the new `@fundroom/chat-slack` adapter and `ModuleServices.chat` (`notify.manage`). Instant mail is sent by a job outside the transaction that created it, with deterministic idempotency keys, retry backoff and a terminal failed state.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Managed-host control plane. Everything here is inert unless `CONTROL_PLANE=on`, which requires `TENANCY_MODE=multi`. A default self-hosted install sees no change: no quotas, no suspension, and 404 from the new routes.
  
  - **Operators.** Platform operators are granted only by the CLI (`fundroom operator enrol-link|grant|revoke|list`), and only to accounts that already have a passkey or TOTP (`enrol-link` prints a one-time link that, together with the mailbox, lets a new operator enrol one). They sign in to the `/platform` console with a separate `__Host-op_sid` session, minted from a fresh passkey or authenticator proof (with a factor older than the grant) on the canonical host and optionally fenced by `PLATFORM_OPERATOR_CIDRS`. Everyone else gets a plain 404. Operators can create, suspend, unsuspend and move workspaces, manage plans, work the sanctions queue, and read the platform audit chain and queue health. They never see tenant content, and every write is audited on the tenant's chain and the platform's.
  - **Workspace status.** A workspace carries independent holds (sanctions review, operator, billing, sanctions), each lifted only by its owner, and its status is derived from them. A suspended or held workspace answers 423 to its staff and 404 to everyone else, except the owner's billing page. Its outgoing mail, updates and webhooks are deferred.
  - **Cells.** Workspaces are placed on cells (`CELL_ID`, `fundroom cell list|add|drain`); a request that reaches the wrong cell gets `421 wrong_cell` with `X-Fundroom-Cell`.
  - **Plans and usage.** Plans (`fundroom plan list|upsert`, or the console) limit staff and investor seats, storage and custom domains with `402 plan_limit`, and apply only to workspaces that have a plan. A daily `core.tenant_usage_daily` rollup gets storage and documents viewed from a new optional module `usage` hook (data room, analytics).
  - **Billing** (`BILLING_DRIVER=manual|stripe`). Stripe Checkout and the Customer Portal pin API version `2026-08-26.dahlia`, with optional metered prices per plan (`plan upsert --metered-price`) billed from daily seat and storage meter events. Signed webhooks are treated as wake-ups that re-read the subscription. Owners get a grace period (`BILLING_GRACE_DAYS`) and emails before a billing suspension. Deleted and sanctioned workspaces have their subscriptions cancelled.
  - **Sanctions screening** (`SANCTIONS_DRIVER=ofac|opensanctions`). New tenant companies are screened against the OFAC SDN and consolidated lists, matched locally with Cyrillic/Greek transliteration, or through OpenSanctions/yente (commercial data licence required; the key goes only over https to `api.opensanctions.org` or `SANCTIONS_OPENSANCTIONS_API_KEY_HOSTS`). Operators can correct a company's legal name and country, which re-screens it. Lifting a confirmed sanctions suspension needs a newer clean screening and a second operator. A new workspace is held until it clears, list changes trigger a re-screen, and potential matches wait for an operator decision. A re-screen never takes a live portal down by itself.
  - **Signup.** Optional self-service signup (`SIGNUP_MODE=open`) on the canonical host, with explicit terms acceptance (`signupTerms` in the page config) and per-IP and per-network budgets.
  
  Two parts work on any multi-tenant install, with or without the control plane:
  
  - **Central auth origin** (`CENTRAL_AUTH=on`). Custom domains and slug hosts sign in through `BASE_URL` and receive a session bound to that workspace by a one-time, verifier-bound code. Passkeys therefore work on custom domains. Account settings from such a session answer `bound_session_restricted`.
  - **Cloudflare for SaaS custom-domain driver** (`CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DRIVER=cloudflare-saas`). The domain is registered with Cloudflare only after our own DNS verification, and becomes active only when Cloudflare says so. `CLOUDFLARE_TRUSTED_PROXY=on` reads `CF-Connecting-IP` from Cloudflare's published ranges only.
  
  Also fixed: on a `<slug>.<canonical>` host, a `/w/<other>` or `/embed/<other>` path could resolve another workspace; the host's slug now wins and a different path slug is a 404. With the control plane on, `/w/<slug>` on the canonical host redirects to the slug host. `@fundroom/identity` caps concurrent sessions per population, so an operator or bound session never evicts an ordinary one.
  
  Compose passes every new key through with empty defaults (everything off). Docs: runbooks `control-plane.md`, `billing.md`, `sanctions.md`, `central-auth.md` and a Cloudflare for SaaS section in `custom-domains.md`; threat-model entries T18–T22.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Engagement analytics and staff notifications. Two new module packages. `@fundroom/module-analytics` (`analytics` schema: `view_session`, `event` RANGE-partitioned by month, the `page_open` dwell accumulator, per-viewer and per-day rollups behind a keyset cursor; `/api/v1/analytics/*`: the page-dwell heartbeat and close beacon, the investor transparency notice, the staff overview, per-document "who viewed", per-viewer page dwell, the keyset-paged per-contact timeline, mode/retention settings and DSAR erasure; jobs `analytics.flush`, `analytics.rollup` and `analytics.maintain` for partition creation and retention drops). `@fundroom/module-notify` (`notify` schema: per-member cadence preferences, member settings, the inbox and digests; `/api/v1/notify/*`; fan-out from `document.viewed`, `document.downloaded` and `update.replied` deduped on a UNIQUE hour-bucket key, instant email marked sent by compare-and-set, one daily digest per member; jobs `notify.deliver` and `notify.digest`). `modules/updates` now publishes `update.viewed` from the archive read for external readers — the topic was catalogued and consumed but never emitted. Matrix permissions `analytics.read` / `analytics.settings` (`notify.read` was already present) and ten new analytics routes. Web: `/admin/analytics` (overview, who-viewed, per-page dwell, contact timeline, settings with the `fresh` step-up, DSAR erase), `/admin/notify` (inbox and preferences), the dwell heartbeat wired into the data-room viewer, and the investor "what this workspace records" notice on the portal settings page.
  
  Privacy is in the schema rather than in a setting: no email address, IP address or User-Agent string is stored — a hashed session id, a browser family and an IP HMAC under the workspace's `analytics-ip` data key — and `analytics.mode` (`off | essential | engagement`) silences the writers. A heartbeat is accepted only when the caller's session already carries a server-recorded view of that resource, so a member cannot record dwell against — or appear in the "who viewed" list of — a document they never opened.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Offering mode and legal templates.
  
  New `@fundroom/compliance`: the shipped legal-template library (12 counsel-review-headed Markdown templates compiled into the package by a committed codegen step), the offering/document/acceptance/consent/relationship services, and the `LegalServices` implementation. `@fundroom/db` migration `0006_compliance`: `core.offering_period` (append-only status history, one open row per workspace, closable but never rewritable), `core.legal_document` + `core.legal_document_version` (immutable, sha256-stamped published versions), `core.consent_event` (append-only, unbundled from notice acceptance), `core.membership.relationship_note` + `first_exposure_at`, and a **tightening of `core.attestation`'s RLS**, which shipped in E0.3 with a permissive policy that let any member of a workspace read another member's legal facts. `updateOfferingStatus` on the workspace accessors.
  
  Acceptance of a legal document is a `core.attestation` row of kind `<slug>:v<n>`, which is the shape the NDA gate already matches, so an accepted NDA settles its own gate. The gate itself is enforced in `requireMember`, not in the SPA: an external member owing a required acceptance is refused everything but the routes that let them read and accept it.
  
  `@fundroom/domain` gains the `legal` settings block (`consentMode`, `enforceAcceptance`, `relationshipWarningDays`, `defaultDisclaimerSlug`). **`analytics.mode` now defaults to `essential` rather than `engagement`** — a behaviour change for any workspace that never wrote the key, and the point of it: a tenant who has not thought about consent no longer measures page dwell by default. Together with the new consent capture this closes R13 and the risk E1.5 booked.
  
  `@fundroom/module-kit`: `LegalServices` on `ModuleServices` (resolve a disclaimer, get a snapshot stamp, read consent, ask whether a purpose is permitted) and `offeringStatusRules.disabledWhen`, which switches a module off for staff too where `hiddenWhen` only hides it from investors. `modules/content` gains a `disclaimer` block hydrated through that port and stamps `page_revision.disclaimer_version` at publish (migration `0002`); `modules/updates` fills the `post_version.disclaimer_version` column reserved for this epic, and now hydrates reference blocks for emailed updates — previously an emailed disclaimer would have carried its slug and no text. `modules/analytics` asks the kernel whether it may record dwell: `GET /analytics/notice` returns one `dwell` boolean folding the workspace mode, the consent mode, the member's stored answer and their Global Privacy Control header, and the browser obeys only that.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add search, workspace export and import, accessibility and i18n coverage.
  
  - **Search.** `GET /api/v1/search` and a search box in the portal and admin headers (`/` or Ctrl/Cmd+K).
    - The index covers data-room documents and folders (with extracted PDF text), published content-page sections and sent updates.
    - Access is filtered on every query by row security plus an authz check per document. A gated document is findable by its title only; nothing in the response depends on its body.
    - Queries are lexed by Postgres's own parser, so emails, file names, decimals and hyphenated dates are found as written.
    - `fundroom search reindex` rebuilds the index, and a 10-minute sweep rebuilds it by itself after deploys and imports.
  - **Workspace export.**
    - `/admin/settings/export` (owner, step-up) and `fundroom workspace export` produce a signed, streamed zip. It holds every table as JSONL, the audit chain, and every document in plaintext.
    - Exports are stored encrypted, expire after seven days, and can be checked offline with `fundroom workspace verify-export`.
  - **Workspace import.**
    - `fundroom workspace import <file> --slug <new>` recreates the workspace with fresh ids.
    - Members are matched to existing accounts by email, and blobs are re-encrypted under the new workspace's keys. Search and access are rebuilt afterwards.
    - It refuses unsigned files unless `--allow-unverified` is given, along with malformed archives and any file that names objects or rows of another workspace.
  - **Accessibility.**
    - The data-room viewer is keyboard-complete: zoom keys, go to page, a roving toolbar, a `?` shortcut sheet and thumbnails for every page. Each page has a screen-reader text layer (`GET /data-room/documents/{id}/pages/{n}/text`).
    - A public `/accessibility` statement is served per workspace.
    - A new `a11y` CI job runs real-browser axe (WCAG 2.2 AA including contrast) on 16 key pages for every pull request.
    - The muted text colour now meets 4.5:1 everywhere.
  - **i18n.**
    - An `en-XA` pseudo-locale proves the investor UI has no hard-coded English, and `pnpm lint:i18n` enforces that for every future change.
    - The UI package has no English defaults, messages use real plurals, and emails render in the recipient's language.
    - Users choose their language in settings (`PUT /me/locale`), and admins set a workspace default (`PUT /workspace/locale`).
  - **Fixes.**
    - Database pools now log idle-connection errors instead of crashing the process.
    - Three GitHub workflows used `hashFiles` in job-level conditions, which GitHub rejects, so they never started. They are fixed, and a new actionlint check keeps them that way.

### Patch Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Plans can now say which optional modules and features a workspace may turn on. Nothing
  changes on an install with `CONTROL_PLANE=off` or for a workspace without a plan.
  
  - `PlanLimits` gains `modules` (optional module ids) and `features` (`qa`, `api_keys`, `webhooks`,
    `integrations`, `esign`, `accreditation`, `sso`, `scim`, `forensic`, `anchoring`, `ai`,
    `access_reviews`). Left out means all; `[]` means none. No migration: plans are written with
    `limits_schema_version` 2, and version 1 rows read as "all".
  - Turning on something the plan leaves out answers `402 plan_limit` with `limit: "module"` (and `module`)
    or `limit: "feature"` (and `feature`). The answer comes only after the route's own authentication and
    authorization, so it never reveals a plan to someone the route would not serve.
  - A downgrade freezes the configuration: what is on stays on, can be maintained (re-keying a connection,
    rotating secrets and tokens, removing webhook topics, re-verifying) and can be turned off, but nothing new
    can be added or turned on. A module that is on but outside the plan becomes read-only for staff: writes
    answer 402, DELETE and the withdraw routes keep working, restoring from the trash waits for an upgrade,
    investors are unaffected and jobs keep running. New AI requests and completing an access review stop.
  - Audit anchoring and verification are unchanged: every workspace is anchored and verified whatever its
    plan. On a plan without `anchoring`, downloading a proof (`GET /audit/anchors/{checkpointId}/proof`)
    answers 402, and `GET /audit/anchors` adds `planAllows`. After an upgrade every past proof is available.
  - Settings writers (branding, legal, access, embed, and the updates, content, metrics, round and analytics
    modules) now write only their own block of the workspace settings (`updateWorkspaceSettingsBlock` in
    `@fundroom/db`), so one can no longer put back a value another just changed.
  - Operators: `GET /platform/plans` returns `entitlementCatalog`. A module that is not an optional module
    of the build is `400 validation_failed` (`reason: "unknown_module"`). `fundroom plan upsert` takes
    `--modules` and `--features` (`ids`, `all` or `none`) and keeps any list a command does not mention,
    `--limits` included; `PATCH /platform/plans/{id}` still replaces the whole object. The plan editor in
    `/platform` has Modules and Features checklists.
  - Workspace UI: "Not on your plan" and "Read-only on your plan" on the modules page and in the setup wizard,
    a read-only banner on the module's admin pages, a notice on each feature's settings page, proof downloads
    disabled on the audit page, warnings on removals that can't be redone on the plan, and the plan's modules
    and features on the Billing page. `GET /modules/enablement` adds `planAllows` and `readOnly` (`lockedReason: "plan"`), the
    bootstrap adds `modules[].readOnly` and `entitlements` (staff only), and `GET /ai/status` adds
    `planAllows`.
