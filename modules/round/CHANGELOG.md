# @fundroom/module-round

## 0.1.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add accreditation vendor adapters: per-workspace VerifyInvestor.com and Parallel Markets connections, vendor-decided 506(c) verifications with stored certificates, and a verification lifecycle (polling, expiry, reminders, renewal).

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add the admin surfaces.
  
  - **Audit log.** Filterable, paginated log with chain verification. The signed export is an Ed25519-signed zip holding JSONL, CSV and checkpoints, and `fundroom audit verify-export` checks it offline. That command exits 3 when the bundle's origin is not pinned to a trusted key.
  - **Access review.** A report covering activity, gates and accreditation-window divergence. The reviewer attests to the report they saw, and its canonical JSON is stored as evidence.
  - **Sessions admin.** Admins can list and revoke a member's sessions in this workspace.
  - **View as investor.** A read-only view of the portal with a banner, audited start and end, and read-only database transactions.
  - **Danger zones.** Transfer ownership, revoke all sessions and delete workspace, each needing typed confirmation and step-up. Delete is a soft delete with a 30-day restore window (`fundroom workspace restore`) and a nightly crypto-shred purge.
  - **Data subject requests.** Access and rectification requests alongside erasure. A subject export bundle collects data through a per-module `dsar.export` hook. Identity erasure runs as the last step.
  - **Settings and operations.** Module settings pages through a new `admin.settings` slot. A jobs/dead-letter page (`fundroom jobs dlq`) and `/api/v1/ops/health` with custom-domain certificate expiry.
  - **Pool-deadlock fixes.** Removed three pool deadlocks: `legal.isErased`/`allowsPurpose` from an investor context, and two in the updates module (replies and the archive read).

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add API keys and outbound webhooks.
  
  **API keys.** Owners and admins mint scoped `frk_` keys under `/admin/api-keys`. Each key acts as its creator, capped by its scopes, and only on routes whose matrix row is `apiKey: true`; 27 routes accept keys so far. Every other route answers 401 `api_key_not_allowed`. Tokens are stored as sha256 hashes. Rotation has a 0–168 h grace window. Each key is limited to 600 requests a minute, and a workspace can hold at most 50 live keys. Keys record when they were last used, and their creator's departure or erasure revokes them. Audit rows written with a key carry `meta.apiKeyId`. The SDK takes an `apiKey` option.
  
  **Outbound webhooks.** Webhooks are managed under `/admin/webhooks` and cover 17 manifest-declared topics. Deliveries follow the Standard Webhooks format: bodies carry ids only, and session and user ids are stripped. Each delivery is fanned out from the outbox and retried ten times over about 47 h. Failed deliveries can be redelivered from a delivery log. An endpoint is disabled after a 410 or 20 exhausted deliveries.
  
  **Webhook privacy and verification.** Person-level topics are gated by analytics consent, and consent, erasure and subscription are re-checked at every attempt. Signing secrets can be rotated with an overlap window. The SDK exports `verifyWebhook`.
  
  **Configuration and supporting changes.**
  - New config: `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`.
  - `@fundroom/outbound-http` gains `oversizeResponse: "truncate"`.
  - Erasure now locks the member's key rows before the audit chain.
  - Migration: core `0018_api_keys_webhooks`.
  - Developer docs are in `docs/api/`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add e-signature, the round closing workflow and signed-document vaulting.
  
  **E-signature.** A workspace connects one vendor under `/admin/esign`: Documenso or DocuSeal (cloud or self-hosted), DocuSign or Dropbox Sign, reached over their APIs only. Credentials are sealed per workspace, verified with the vendor before they are stored, and never shown again. Vendor callbacks arrive at `/webhooks/esign/{connectionId}`. They are authenticated per vendor and treated only as a wake-up: the server then asks the vendor for the envelope's status. A five-minute sweep backs them up. Signed PDFs (and the vendor's certificate where separate) are size-capped, scanned and stored encrypted.
  
  **E-sign NDA.** A legal document's ceremony can be click-wrap (default) or e-signature (NDA documents only). Investors record ESIGN consent to electronic records, sign in the vendor's UI (opened top-level, never inside an embed frame), and the completed envelope writes the same acceptance a click-wrap does, so the portal gate and NDA gates on folders and documents open as before.
  
  **Closing workflow.** A round's Closing tab sends subscription documents from a vendor template, prefilled from the round's terms, and tracks each commitment through documents sent, signed, wired and confirmed, with a summary of counts and amounts. Investors see their own checklist and download their signed copy.
  
  **Vaulting.** Completed envelopes are filed into the data room under legal hold, in staff-only folders that no investor, delegate or share-link grant can open.
  
  **Fixes found along the way.**
  - An NDA or accreditation gate on a sub-folder or document now applies to members granted an ancestor folder (it previously did not).
  - The workspace row is now always locked before the audit chain, removing a class of deadlocks between settings, acceptance, group and document writers.
  - The first concurrent use of a new encryption-key purpose no longer fails with an aborted transaction.
  
  **Configuration.** New: `ESIGN_DRIVERS`, `ESIGN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`, `ESIGN_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES`. Migrations: core `0019_esign`, round `0004_closing`, data-room `0004_vault` and `0005_staff_only`, notify `0010_esign_event_types`. Operator guide in `docs/esign/`.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Round, interest form and CRM-lite. A workspace can describe the round it is raising — stage, instrument, target, minimum and the terms themselves as an append-only series of revisions — and an investor can read those terms, see what an amount would buy them and indicate interest, with the accreditation path decided on the server from the offering status, the subject and the amount rather than re-derived in the browser. Two new shared packages carry the parts both sides need: `@fundroom/decimal`, the fixed-point arithmetic promoted out of `modules/metrics` now that money is added in a second place, and `@fundroom/round-terms`, holding the SAFE, convertible-note and priced-round zod schemas, the ownership calculator with its plain-English explanations and assumptions, the US accreditation-path rule with the minimum-investment safe harbour, and the allocation roll-up that every progress figure in the product reads. Metrics keeps its public surface unchanged and re-exports the decimal module from the package, so there is still exactly one implementation.
  
  Accreditation stops being something a module can write for itself. `LegalServices` (`@fundroom/module-kit`) gains `accreditation`, `certifyAccreditation`, `recordVerifiedAccreditation` and `noteExposure`; `@fundroom/compliance` implements them over the existing acceptance service, so a self-certification still produces exactly the two attestation rows E2.3 froze — the click-wrap record of agreeing to a text, and the dated `accredited` fact the policy gate reads — while a staff decision records one row whose `data.method` is prefixed `verified:`, with the evidence named by reference and never copied. A verification with no evidence behind it is refused, and a workspace that has published no accreditation questionnaire gets the new `accreditation_unavailable` (409) rather than a 500 or a misleading `not_found`. `@fundroom/ports` gains `AccreditationVerificationPort` and the new `@fundroom/accred-manual` adapter answers it for `ACCREDITATION_DRIVER=manual`: every attempt stays pending until a person reads the evidence, because claiming otherwise would assert on the issuer's behalf that it took the reasonable steps Rule 506(c) requires. `ModuleServices` carries the port, with `ContainerOptions`/`StartOptions` overrides for tests. `@fundroom/domain` adds the nine `round.*` outbox topics (ids only — the amount an investor named stays on the fenced, audited row) and the `round` workspace-settings block (evidence retention, default currency). `@fundroom/module-notify` learns two instant event types, `round.interest_submitted` and `round.verification_requested`, addressed to staff holding `round.manage` rather than `notify.read` so a viewer who cannot open the round does not learn by email who wants into it; migration `0002_round_event_types` widens both CHECK constraints. `@fundroom/authz` carries the full `round.*` and `crm.*` permission and route matrix.
  
  CRM-lite ships as its own module rather than as part of `round`, and the cut is the offering rules': `round` is disabled outright in `none` and `informational`, while a CRM is exactly what a founder uses before there is anything to offer, so `@fundroom/module-crm` declares no offering rules at all and a workspace tracking relationships keeps its board with the round module switched off underneath it. It owns seven tables in a `crm` schema whose every row-security policy admits staff and system and nobody else: organisations, contacts that are not logins (an optional `membership_id` link, a generated `search_tsv`, at most one live contact per member), a tenant-editable stage ladder with stable keys seeded lazily on the first read, per-round pipeline cards whose `amount` is a forecast and whose `commitment_id` is a soft reference to the round module's system of record, polymorphic notes and tasks, and a `stage_transition` history that records every move with its cause and both stage keys. The only coupling to `round` is four outbox subscribers — interest submitted, interest decided, commitment created, commitment changed — each idempotent under redelivery, silent for a workspace that has the module switched off, and tolerant of a stage a tenant has renamed away; nothing is emitted back. Every mutation is audited with ids, keys and counts only: no email, no name, no note body.
  
  The round itself ships as `@fundroom/module-round`, off by default and **disabled outright** while the workspace's offering status is `none` or `informational` — the two states where `permits(status).roundAndTerms` is false. That gate applies to staff as well, so an `informational` workspace's owner gets the same 404 an investor does; a compliance control an admin can walk around is no control. Six tables in a `round` schema: the round, its terms as an append-only series of revisions (a trigger refuses every update but the one that supersedes, and a deferrable exclusion constraint keeps exactly one live revision per round), interest submissions carrying the offering status and accreditation path of the moment they were made, verifications, the commitments that are the system of record for the money, and a closing checklist. Row security lets an investor read an open or closed round and its terms, read and write their own submissions, read their own verifications — and reach `commitment` and `closing_task` not at all, because what another investor put in is not their business.
  
  An investor's page arrives in one read: the round, the live terms, the disclaimer that was in force when they were written, the progress bar when the workspace has chosen to show one, the member's own submissions and a preview of which accreditation path their amount would take. Viewing it stamps `first_exposure_at` the first time — under Rule 506(b) what matters is whether the relationship pre-dated the offer, so the column is written once and never overwritten — and records a `round.terms_viewed` audit row naming the revision, the disclaimer stamp and the offering status, throttled to once per session per revision so a refresh is not an audit row. Indicating interest is rate-limited to five an hour, records the questionnaire through the kernel's acceptance service rather than by touching `core.attestation`, and under Rule 506(c) below the minimum-investment safe harbour opens a verification the company has to settle before it can accept: a self-certification does not open that door, however recent, which is the difference between 506(b) and 506(c) made enforceable rather than documented. Evidence is uploaded on a raw route in front of the JSON body limit, virus-scanned, envelope-encrypted under the workspace key before a byte reaches storage, readable only by staff holding `round.manage`, and deleted by a nightly job once the decision is older than the workspace's retention window — while the decision, its method and the digest of what was read survive, which is what keeps a verification provable after somebody's tax return is gone. Opening, closing and the commitments CSV need step-up. The `round_summary` content block renders for members and staff and gives an anonymous reader an empty payload even in a public section: no offering content is reachable anonymously, and on a 506(b) page that is not a UI mistake.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Add search, workspace export and import, accessibility and i18n coverage.
  
  - **Search.** `GET /api/v1/search` and a search box in the portal and admin headers (`/` or Ctrl/Cmd+K).
    - The index covers data-room documents and folders (with extracted PDF text), published content-page sections and sent updates.
    - Access is filtered on every query by row security plus an authz check per document. A gated document is findable by its title only; nothing in the response depends on its body.
    - Queries are lexed by Postgres's own parser, so emails, file names, decimals and hyphenated dates are found as written.
    - `fundroom search reindex` rebuilds the index, and a 10-minute sweep rebuilds it by itself after deploys and imports.
  - **Workspace export.**
    - `/admin/settings/export` (owner, step-up) and `fundroom workspace export` produce a signed, streamed zip. It holds every table as JSONL, the audit chain, and every document in plaintext.
    - Exports are stored encrypted, expire after seven days, and can be checked offline with `fundroom workspace verify-export`.
  - **Workspace import.**
    - `fundroom workspace import <file> --slug <new>` recreates the workspace with fresh ids.
    - Members are matched to existing accounts by email, and blobs are re-encrypted under the new workspace's keys. Search and access are rebuilt afterwards.
    - It refuses unsigned files unless `--allow-unverified` is given, along with malformed archives and any file that names objects or rows of another workspace.
  - **Accessibility.**
    - The data-room viewer is keyboard-complete: zoom keys, go to page, a roving toolbar, a `?` shortcut sheet and thumbnails for every page. Each page has a screen-reader text layer (`GET /data-room/documents/{id}/pages/{n}/text`).
    - A public `/accessibility` statement is served per workspace.
    - A new `a11y` CI job runs real-browser axe (WCAG 2.2 AA including contrast) on 16 key pages for every pull request.
    - The muted text colour now meets 4.5:1 everywhere.
  - **i18n.**
    - An `en-XA` pseudo-locale proves the investor UI has no hard-coded English, and `pnpm lint:i18n` enforces that for every future change.
    - The UI package has no English defaults, messages use real plurals, and emails render in the recipient's language.
    - Users choose their language in settings (`PUT /me/locale`), and admins set a workspace default (`PUT /workspace/locale`).
  - **Fixes.**
    - Database pools now log idle-connection errors instead of crashing the process.
    - Three GitHub workflows used `hashFiles` in job-level conditions, which GitHub rejects, so they never started. They are fixed, and a new actionlint check keeps them that way.

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Close the v1.0 carry-overs. Investors can add delegates (scope: everything, data room only, or updates only) from portal settings, and admins can add or remove them from a person's page. A delegate borrows a scoped subset of its investor's access, is bound by both its investor's exclusions and its own, signs its own gates, and loses everything as soon as its investor's access ends. Sign-in now refuses a person whose every membership has expired (`membership_expired`, after the credential is proven). The last-owner floor counts only active, unexpired owners and every owner-removing path locks first. Invite grants and imported rule paths are re-derived from the resource, so a folder move or an old over-broad path can no longer widen access. A daily job reminds `access.manage` holders about overdue access reviews. Trusted Types is enforced by default (`CSP_TRUSTED_TYPES`), the HIBP check's failure mode is configurable and audited (`AUTH_HIBP_FAIL_MODE`), web source maps are no longer served, module raw routes run the kernel guards, and a behavioural authz sweep checks every route against the matrix. Fixes the post-sign-in "no access" screen caused by a stale bootstrap cache. Migrations: core `0017_delegates`; notify `0007`, `0008`; round `0003`; metrics `0004`; content `0003`; updates `0003`.

### Patch Changes

- [`538f8b3`](https://github.com/fundroomhq/fundroom/commit/538f8b3b40aafd77196e2c0d6ba66bb8ebe3ad5b) Thanks [@fundroomio](https://github.com/fundroomio)! - Plans can now say which optional modules and features a workspace may turn on. Nothing
  changes on an install with `CONTROL_PLANE=off` or for a workspace without a plan.
  
  - `PlanLimits` gains `modules` (optional module ids) and `features` (`qa`, `api_keys`, `webhooks`,
    `integrations`, `esign`, `accreditation`, `sso`, `scim`, `forensic`, `anchoring`, `ai`,
    `access_reviews`). Left out means all; `[]` means none. No migration: plans are written with
    `limits_schema_version` 2, and version 1 rows read as "all".
  - Turning on something the plan leaves out answers `402 plan_limit` with `limit: "module"` (and `module`)
    or `limit: "feature"` (and `feature`). The answer comes only after the route's own authentication and
    authorization, so it never reveals a plan to someone the route would not serve.
  - A downgrade freezes the configuration: what is on stays on, can be maintained (re-keying a connection,
    rotating secrets and tokens, removing webhook topics, re-verifying) and can be turned off, but nothing new
    can be added or turned on. A module that is on but outside the plan becomes read-only for staff: writes
    answer 402, DELETE and the withdraw routes keep working, restoring from the trash waits for an upgrade,
    investors are unaffected and jobs keep running. New AI requests and completing an access review stop.
  - Audit anchoring and verification are unchanged: every workspace is anchored and verified whatever its
    plan. On a plan without `anchoring`, downloading a proof (`GET /audit/anchors/{checkpointId}/proof`)
    answers 402, and `GET /audit/anchors` adds `planAllows`. After an upgrade every past proof is available.
  - Settings writers (branding, legal, access, embed, and the updates, content, metrics, round and analytics
    modules) now write only their own block of the workspace settings (`updateWorkspaceSettingsBlock` in
    `@fundroom/db`), so one can no longer put back a value another just changed.
  - Operators: `GET /platform/plans` returns `entitlementCatalog`. A module that is not an optional module
    of the build is `400 validation_failed` (`reason: "unknown_module"`). `fundroom plan upsert` takes
    `--modules` and `--features` (`ids`, `all` or `none`) and keeps any list a command does not mention,
    `--limits` included; `PATCH /platform/plans/{id}` still replaces the whole object. The plan editor in
    `/platform` has Modules and Features checklists.
  - Workspace UI: "Not on your plan" and "Read-only on your plan" on the modules page and in the setup wizard,
    a read-only banner on the module's admin pages, a notice on each feature's settings page, proof downloads
    disabled on the audit page, warnings on removals that can't be redone on the plan, and the plan's modules
    and features on the Billing page. `GET /modules/enablement` adds `planAllows` and `readOnly` (`lockedReason: "plan"`), the
    bootstrap adds `modules[].readOnly` and `entitlements` (staff only), and `GET /ai/status` adds
    `planAllows`.
